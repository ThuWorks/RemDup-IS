Both provenances need to acclimate to climate warming, yet we lack comprehensive understanding of how their growth, photosynthesis and leaf traits differ. Further, the provenances presumably have morphological and physiological adaptations to their native environments and therefore differ in response to photoperiod. We tested the height growth, leaf longevity, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation and rates of gas exchange of northern (67°N) and southern (61°N) Finnish silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) origins in CL- and NCL-treatments in a 4-month chamber experiment. Irrespective of photoperiod, 67°N had higher area-based photosynthetic rate (Anet), stomatal conductance (gs) and relative height growth rate (RGR), but lower stomatal density and fewer branches and leaves than 61°N. Photoperiod affected height growth cessation, biomass and photosynthetic traits, whereas leaf longevity and many leaf functional traits remained unchanged. In CL, both provenances had lower gs, higher RGR, increased shoot:root ratio and increased sink sizes (more branching, more leaves, increased total plant dry weight) compared with NCL. In NCL, 67°N ceased height growth earlier than in CL, which altered biomass accumulation and distribution patterns. Northern conditions impose challenges for plant growth and physiology. Whether a provenance inhabits and is adapted to an area with or without CL can also affect its response to the changing climate. Northern birches may have adapted to CL and the short growing season with a 'polar day syndrome' of traits, including relatively high gas exchange rates with low leaf biomass and growth traits that are mainly limited by the environment and the earlier growth cessation (to avoid frost damage). © The Author(s) 2022.

However, few studies have investigated the trait covariance in the native and invasive ranges. Such investigation will give a more comprehensive picture of how historical contingency and adaptation shape invasiveness, contributing to the prediction of future invasion dynamics. Here, we collected seven and nine populations alongside latitudes from invasive and native ranges of a global invasive plant, Spartina alterniflora, and planted them in two common gardens at the southernmost and northernmost sites of the invasive range. We measured plant traits, including the first flowering time, plant height and seed set, and analysed how these traits varied with garden sites and populations' origin latitudes and how their covariance changed between ranges. We found that plants flowered later, grew taller and set more seeds in the high-latitude garden than the low-latitude one. The growth and expression of genetic variation of traits appeared to be limited by high ambient temperature in the low-latitude garden. In the high-latitude garden, the flowering time of populations showed clinal variation for both invasive and native populations, whereas the plant height and seed set showed clinal variation only for native or invasive populations. From the native to the invasive range, the flowering time and seed set developed negative genetic covariance, and flowering time and plant height changed from negative genetically correlated to uncorrelated. Our results suggested that S. alterniflora has experienced rapid adaptation to clinal and local conditions over the 40-year invasion. Such geographic-scale rapid adaptation appeared to have benefited from previously identified genetic admixture that has released the trait covariance. Our study highlights the importance of integrating full-range geographical surveys with introduction history to understand the potential and mechanisms of trait evolution during invasion.

Terrestrial LL can be consumed by macroinvertebrates and microbes to fuel the detrital-based food webs in freshwaters. To date, our knowledge of LL decomposition in freshwaters is largely based on broadleaved LL, while the patterns and drivers of coniferous leaf-litter (CLL) decomposition in streams and rivers remain poorly understood. Here, we present a global investigation of CLL decomposition in streams and rivers by collecting data from 35 publications. We compared LL breakdown rates in this study with other global-scale studies (including conifers and broadleaved species), between evergreen and deciduous conifers, and between native and invasive conifers. We also investigated the climatic, geographic (latitude and altitude), stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors (e.g., mesh size and experimental duration) in influencing CLL decomposition. We found that the following: (1) LL breakdown rates in this study were 18.5–28.8 and 4.9–16.8% slower than those in other global-scale studies when expressed as per day and per degree day, respectively. Conifer LL in coarse mesh bags, for evergreen and invasive conifers, decomposed 13.6, 10.3, and 10.8% faster than in fine mesh bags, for deciduous and native conifers, respectively; (2) CLL traits, stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors explained higher variations in CLL decomposition than climatic and geographic factors; (3) CLL nutritional quality (N and P), water temperature, and experimental duration were better predictors of CLL decomposition than other predictors in categories of LL traits, stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors, respectively; and (4) total and microbial-mediated CLL breakdown rates showed linear relationships with latitude, altitude, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation. Our results imply that the replacement of native forests by conifer plantation would impose great impacts on adjacent freshwaters by retarding the LL processing rate. Moreover, future climate warming which is very likely to happen in mid- and high-latitude areas according to the IPCC 6th report would accelerate LL decomposition, with a potential consequence of food depletion for detritivores in freshwaters during hot summers.

As J. aquatica mainly occurs in species-rich wet grasslands, our aim was to define management measures that do not reduce the conservation value of the resident communities. Location: Data were collected from 20 independent sites which varied in productivity and management intensity across the pre-alpine Allgäu region (South Germany). Methods: We monitored effects of temporary abandonment and decreased mowing intensity in very low- and low-productive sites, as well as of decreased mowing and fertilization at moderately productive sites. Abundances of J. aquatica and the co-occurring species were recorded at start and end of two experiments (2018–2021: very low- and low-productive conservation grasslands; 2017–2020: moderately productive agricultural grasslands), while functional traits data of all species were gathered from the literature and specific databases. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were used to analyse the effects of management intensity on the abundance of J. aquatica, functional diversity and species richness of the resident communities. Results: At all productivity levels, the abundance of J. aquatica declined under reduced management. Changes in community composition and species richness of the resident community were less pronounced than the reduction of J. aquatica, but species richness declined under lowest management intensities. Thus, moderate reduction in management intensity provided the most benefits in terms of reduction of J. aquatica, and maintenance of species richness and composition of the resident plant community. Conclusions: Reducing management intensity in wet grasslands decreases the abundance of J. aquatica and thus is a suitable method to control this species. As plant community responses were only partially consistent, management plans must account for the productivity of invaded sites. To avoid negative effects on grassland biodiversity, only moderate suppression of J. aquatica is recommended. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the effect of height on fruit and seed traits in invasive vines of Cucurbitaceae has not been intensively studied so far. In Europe, Echinocystis lobata, a North American member of Cucurbitaceae, is considered one of the most abundant invasive alien plants spreading in natural riparian forests, thickets, and tall herbs, whereas it is a rare species in urban woodlands. In this study, we tested the variability of selected fruit and seed traits of E. lobata in connection with habitat origin (natural, semi-natural, and anthropogenic), habitat type (using the EUNIS habitat classification), height (the distance between the fruit and the ground), and geographical position. The study was conducted in 2018 in 65 sites located in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. In each study site, a random sample of 10 fresh mature fruits of E. lobata was collected from subsequent 0.50 m intervals of height. The length, the width, and the weight of the fresh fruits, as well as the total number of seeds and number of undeveloped seeds per fruit, were examined. Moreover, the well-developed seeds from selected study sites were weighed. The statistical analysis showed the significant effect of habitat origin, habitat type, and height on most of the studied fruit and seed traits. The largest range of height (from 0.00 to 4.00 m) was observed in two types of habitats (F— heathland, scrub, and tundra; and G—woodland, forest, and other wooded land). The total number of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with the length, width, and weight of the fresh fruits. The fruits were a little heavier and bigger in natural habitats located in the northeast of the study area. The distribution of fruits at different heights may contribute to better dispersal of seeds by animals and wind, and may also better protect the seeds from being eaten by granivorous animals. The defence against seed-eating animals is expected to be stronger in semi-natural habitats, as well as on banks and shores of inland surface waters, where the seed production is the highest. The influence of seed traits on seed germination and seedling survival in various habitats and their importance in the invasiveness of E. lobata require further study. © 2022 by the authors.

Plant species (chickpeas cv. Saral and wild mustard) were compared at freezing temperatures (+4 as a control, 0, −4, −8, −12, −16, and −20°C) based on the morphophysiological traits and their recovery ability. Chickpea chlorophyll fluorescence was more sensitive to low temperatures than wild mustard. Chickpea and wild mustard Fv′/Fm′ (light-adapted maximum efficiency of photosystem II [PSII] photochemistry) decrease 33% and 11% exposed to −16°C, respectively, compared with +4°C. Particularly at lower temperatures, wild mustard electrolyte leakage was smaller than that of chickpea; the temperature drop had a greater impact on the stems than the leaves. Per temperature degree drop from −12 to −20°C, the survival probability decreased by 12.5%. Wild mustard had a greater root dry matter (RDM) compared with chickpea plants. 50% dry matter depression temperature (RDMT50) could better distinguish among the species freezing response; wild mustard RDMT50 was ~1°C higher than chickpea. Plant survival and Fv′/Fm′ correlation suggested the reliability of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements to assay plants freezing tolerance. The important contribution of a more powerful root system to wild mustard survival under adverse circumstances may be suggested by the positive association between plant survival and RDM. Higher tolerance of wild mustard to freezing stress ultimately leads to greater survival, regeneration, continued growth, and geographical distribution. Therefore, the wild mustard invasion will be possible in chickpea fields after freezing stress, especially in the cold climates and high-altitude regions. © 2022 The Authors.

To gain a detailed insight into blue C storage and controlling factors, we studied 142 sites across ca. 5000 km of coastal wetlands, covering temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates in China. The wetlands represented six vegetation types (Phragmites australis, mixed of P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda, Spartina alterniflora, mangrove [Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina], tidal flat) and three vegetation types invaded by S. alterniflora (P. australis, K. obovata, A. marina). Our results revealed large spatial heterogeneity in SOC density of the top 1-m ranging 40–200 Mg C ha−1, with higher values in mid-latitude regions (25–30° N) compared with those in both low- (20°N) and high-latitude (38–40°N) regions. Vegetation type influenced SOC density, with P. australis and S. alterniflora having the largest SOC density, followed by mangrove, mixed P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda and tidal flat. SOC density increased by 6.25 Mg ha−1 following S. alterniflora invasion into P. australis community but decreased by 28.56 and 8.17 Mg ha−1 following invasion into K. obovata and A. marina communities. Based on field measurements and published literature, we calculated a total inventory of 57 × 106 Mg C in the top 1-m soil across China's coastal wetlands. Edaphic variables controlled SOC content, with soil chemical properties explaining the largest variance in SOC content. Climate did not control SOC content but had a strong interactive effect with edaphic variables. Plant biomass and quality traits were a minor contributor in regulating SOC content, highlighting the importance of quantity and quality of OC inputs and the balance between production and degradation within the coastal wetlands. These findings provide new insights into blue C stabilization mechanisms and sequestration capacity in coastal wetlands. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","blue carbon; climate change; coastal wetlands; mangrove; plant invasion; salt marsh; vegetation type","carbon; chemistry; China; introduced species; physiology; Poaceae; soil; wetland; Carbon; China; Introduced Species; Poaceae; Soil; Wetlands",Article,Scopus

The latter is modifying the distribution of the former, and the magnitude and direction of distributional changes are predicted to vary depending on species dispersal mode. Here, we address the question of whether clonality is expected to affect the future invasion pattern in PAs. Location: Worldwide. Time period: 1950–2100. Major taxa studied: 36 invasive alien plant species. Methods: We used ensembles of three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and Maxent) based on >70,000 occurrence records to project the distribution of 36 of the world's most invasive clonal and non-clonal plants in >20,000 PAs. Projections were based on three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (low, medium and high) for 2080. Results: Climate change showed little impact on the global invasion pattern in PAs, and clonality showed little effect when all biomes were processed in concert. However, we discerned that the future invasion risk of clonal IAPS markedly increased in biomes located at high elevation and high latitude compared with non-clonal IAPS, while the risk decreased in lower-elevation tropical and subtropical biomes where asexual reproduction may be a less successful trait. We also showed that invasion hot spots overlapped with biodiversity hot spots and two realms (i.e. Nearctic and Palearctic), which calls for bridging the gap between invasion and conservation sciences and for more concerted management strategies. Main conclusions: We suggest that effective management of IAPS in PAs should consider in which biomes PAs are located as well as the reproductive traits of IAPS that are present or may become so. © 2021 The Authors.

It is a challenge to project suitable habitat distributions of invasive plant species (IPS) for invasion risk assessment at large spatial scales. Interaction outcomes between native and invasive plant species are dependent as a function of trait context, which may contribute to suitable habitat distributions of IPS. Here, we explored the effect of functional trait context on suitable habitat distribution of invasive plant species at a global scale. The plant functional trait context was quantified based on the community mean values of specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration, height, and woody density. Habitat suitability modeling was used to project suitable habitat distributions of IPS based on functional trait and abiotic (climate, soil, and human footprint) contexts. There were significant differences in contexts between functional traits and abiotic conditions for IPS across different biomes at a global scale. Community mean functional traits, particularly, height could contribute to habitat suitability of IPS. The functional trait context could have a large effect on the habitat suitability of IPS in Boreal forests/Taiga, Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands, Tundra, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub, and Mangroves. Functional trait context could affect suitable habitat distributions of IPS at a global scale, indicating that functional trait context should be used as the input for modeling habitat suitability of IPS.

Under the evolution of increased phenotypic plasticity hypothesis, populations of invasive species have greater phenotypic plasticity than native populations. Studies of this hypothesis have mostly focused on the plasticity of invasive plants to light, water, nutrients, neighbors, and natural enemies. Studies focusing on these key plant traits under warming conditions are mostly concentrated in temperate and tropic regions, while alpine regions are overlooked. Additionally, these studies mostly focus on plant growth-related traits, while relatively little attention has been paid to plant resistance and the secondary metabolites of defense traits in response to warming, especially in alpine region. Here, test for differences in plant fitness traits, important functional traits, and defense traits in response to daily warming between introduced and native populations of invasive plants. Specifically, we explore the following questions: (1) Will the phenotypic plasticity of fitness traits, functional traits and defense traits of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides respond to daily air warming? (2) If so, does this response differ between introduced and native populations? (3) Does this response differ between alpine regions and tropic regions? Methods: Using 6 populations of the invasive plant A. philoxeroides from the introduced region in China and 6 populations from their native region in Argentina, we conducted a field experiment to simulate a daily warming of 2℃ in Lhasa City, Tibet Autonomous Region (Alpine region: 91.04° E, 29.64° N) from August to October 2020. We placed plants from each of the 12 populations into the control plots and the warming plots, and each treatment had three replicates. There were a total of 72 experimental units in the experiment (2 origins × 6 populations × 2 temperature treatments × 3 replicates). After 8 weeks of growth, we harvested all plants and measured the several variables. The fitness traits we measured included total biomass, ground biomass, storage root biomass and hair root biomass. The functional traits we measured included branching intensity, specific stem length, root-to-shoot ratio, and specific leaf area. The defense traits we measured included triterpenoid saponins and flavonoids. Results: Simulated daily warming of 2℃ significantly increased the total biomass of A. philoxeroides (+36.4%), the ground biomass (+34.5%), the storage root biomass (+51.4%), the hair root biomass (+33.6%), and reduced the specific stem length (–30.2%) and branching intensity (–19.8%). Simulated daily warming of 2℃ increased the specific leaf area (+15.1%) and flavonoids (+8.9%) of the introduced populations, while the native populations showed the opposite effect (–22.9%, –30.0%). Conclusions: These results indicate that simulated daily warming of 2℃ in alpine regions is a positive condition for the invasive plant A. philoxeroides. The fitness traits of the introduced populations have greater plasticity to simulated daily warming, and the plasticity of some plant functional traits and defense traits of the introduced populations may have greater fitness in alpine regions. As a consequence, we conclude that increasing temperatures due to global climate change may be beneficial to colonization and spread of introduced populations of A. philoxeroides in the alpine region. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, a notable limitation is that studies usually rely on a small and easy-to-measure set of functional traits, which might not immediately reflect ongoing ecological responses to changing abiotic or biotic conditions, including those that occur at a molecular or physiological level. We explored the potential of using the diversity of expressed genes—functional genomic diversity (FGD)—to understand ecological dynamics of a recent and ongoing alpine invasion. We quantified FGD based on transcriptomic data measured for 26 plant species occurring along adjacent invaded and pristine streambeds. We used an RNA-seq approach to summarize the overall number of expressed transcripts and their annotations to functional categories, and contrasted this with functional trait diversity (FTD) measured from a suite of characters that have been traditionally considered in plant ecology. We found greater FGD and FTD in the invaded community, independent of differences in species richness. However, the magnitude of functional dispersion was greater from the perspective of FGD than from FTD. Comparing FGD between congeneric alien–native species pairs, we did not find many significant differences in the proportion of genes whose annotations matched functional categories. Still, native species with a greater relative abundance in the invaded community compared with the pristine tended to express a greater fraction of genes at significant levels in the invaded community, suggesting that changes in FGD may relate to shifts in community composition. Comparisons of diversity patterns from the community to the species level offer complementary insights into processes and mechanisms driving invasion dynamics. FGD has the potential to illuminate cryptic changes in ecological diversity, and we foresee promising avenues for future extensions across taxonomic levels and macro-ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

Studies on variation in seed traits among populations of an invader along latitudes/longitudes may assist in revealing how invasive plants cope with variable climates. In this study, we collected seeds of 26 populations of the global invasive plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia along ranges spanning 23° latitudes and 20° longitudes that are highly correlated in its invasive range in China. We measured over 20 seed traits, including seed morphology, phytohormone, nutrients, and germination, and investigated how the climate along the latitudes affects those traits. We found that germination time was significantly delayed with increasing latitude and longitude, while the reversed patterns were true for the germination rate. From low to high latitude, seed size, abscisic acid, and fatty acid were increased, likely affecting seed germination. Our analysis further demonstrated that temperature is the dominant driver of the variability in seed traits and germination. Germination rates of larger seeds in cold ranges were lower, while smaller seeds from warm ranges germinated faster, likely indicating adaptive strategies of the invasive plant in seed trait functional ecology. Together, our findings provide new insights into understanding the seed adaptation strategies during the invasion process and the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Yu, Yang, Chen, Yin and Ding.","Ambrosia artemisiifolia; climate; germination; invasion; latitude; longitude",,Article,Scopus

Although a growing number of studies suggest that the dispersal propensity of invasive plants increases during range expansion, there has been relatively little attention paid to dispersal patterns along elevational gradients. In this study, we tested the differentiation of dispersal-related traits in an invasive plant, Galinsoga quadriradiata, across populations at different elevations in the Qinling and Bashan Mountains in central China. Seed mass-area ratio (MAR), an important seed dispersal-related trait, of 45 populations from along an elevational gradient was measured, and genetic variation of 23 populations was quantified using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Individuals from four populations were then planted in a greenhouse to compare their performance under shared conditions. Changing patterns of seed dispersal-related traits and populations genetic diversity along elevation were tested using linear regression. Mass-area ratio of G. quadriradiata increased, while genetic diversity decreased with elevation in the field survey. In the greenhouse, populations of G. quadriradiata sourced from different elevations showed a difference response of MAR. These results suggest that although rapid evolution may contribute to the range expansion of G. quadriradiata in mountain ranges, dispersal-related traits will also likely be affected by phenotypic plasticity. This challenges the common argument that dispersal ability of invasive plants increases along dispersal routes. Furthermore, our results suggest that high-altitude populations would be more effective at seed dispersal once they continue to expand their range downslope on the other side. Our experiment provides novel evidence that the spread of these high-altitude populations may be more likely than previously theorized and that they should thus be cautiously monitored. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Non-indigenous dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) in the treeline ecotone of the Eastern High Sudetes Mountains and its experimental removal is the model example. We asked how species composition and diversity develop after it is clearcut, and what are the main drivers leading to alpine grasslands restoration. On the study site (Jeseníky Mts., the Czech Republic), three distinct habitats were distinguished: plots after clearcut, alpine grasslands, and dwarf pine plantation. Plant species composition was assessed by means of phytosociological relevés together with selected plant traits and environmental factors. We compared temporal trends in species number, diversity, and plant traits among the habitats. Species richness and diversity has increased since the dwarf pine was clearcut. This trend was the same for all three types of habitats studied, although they were significantly different in spatial compositional heterogeneity and species structure. Species composition among study habitats differed and went through its own successive trend of community development during time as the consequence of species turnover. We revealed that light-demanding plant species preferring low nitrogen concentrations were associated with the successional trend after the dwarf pine was clearcut. Dwarf pine removal creates conditions for alpine grassland restoration, but restoration can take a long time because of the environmental conditions, dwarf pine legacy, and plant traits that determine the succession direction.

Alien plants used to pose severe threats to ecosystems, and qualitative studies on weed flora in many interior regions of the Himalaya are still scarce. Patterns of species diversity, biological spectrum, and phenology of weeds growing in the Himalayas with invasive nature were investigated from 2017 to 2019 in thirty-eight localities of interior Kupwara district of Kashmir Himalaya from different agroecological zones. A hierarchical cluster analysis using the presence or absence data of flowering among plant species was performed and a complex Heatmap package was used. Data collected revealed a total of 158 plant species belonging to 115 genera and 35 families identified from a high altitude district Kupwara in India. The species distribution pattern across the families was unequal, with three families share more than half of the species documented, while fifteen families were monotypic. The family Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Brassicaceae were the most important weeds in terms of species abundance and species richness. Asteraceae represented by 35 species, as the dominant family followed by Poaceae with 19 species, and Brassicaceae by 14 species. In terms of functional trait diversity, the annual growth form was dominant over other forms such perennial or biannual. The phytogeographical analysis revealed that the maximum 91 species collected were native, while a minimum of 67 species reported as alien. Of the alien species, 25 were invasive, 35 naturalized, and 7 casual. The biological spectrum revealed the dominance of therophyte life form indicating the disturbed vegetation. The phenological spectrum revealed the maximum flowering period of weeds is between April and September where about 73% of species were observed in full bloom. This research adds an important way to the basic information of biodiversity patterns in the Himalayas and constitutes baseline data for the planned implementation of conservation. The outcomes also provide the baseline information on alien weeds, their invasive nature as well as in for better prediction of phenological shifts associated with these species due to contemporary climate change. It also would help to design conservation and management plans for threatened or otherwise important species for future implementation. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.","Biological spectrum; Conservation; Himalaya; Himalayan weeds; Phenology",,Article,Scopus

Although plant responses in tundra and alpine environments from high latitudes have been well-studied at the community level, the overall effect of warming on global alpine plant populations and species remains unclear. We collated global data from 46 open-top chamber (OTC) studies conducted on alpine plants from mountain belts worldwide and assessed potential effects of warming on plant performance. In addition, we examined warming responses of plants from the tundra zone (Arctic tundra and alpine tundra) in circumpolar regions. In terms of growth and reproductive output, the overall response of 91 plant species was highly positive. Shrubs grew significantly larger and expressed higher reproduction under warming compared to forbs and graminoids. Arctic tundra plants tended to respond more positively to warming compared to alpine tundra plants. We also found that plant responses were greater with increasing precipitation across circumpolar tundra, but not across alpine zones. Phenotypic plasticity in size- and fitness-related traits were similar for both alpine and tundra zones. Our findings support the notion that global warming can cause significant changes to alpine environments. Due to changes in biotic interactions, alpine tundra plants may be more negatively affected by warming compared to Arctic tundra plants which responded more positively to warming. Similarly, if shrubs are most advantaged under warming, their invasion into higher elevations may threaten the ecological functioning of alpine ecosystems, which is another serious challenge from climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Alpine; Arctic; Climate change; Meta-analysis; Phenotypic plasticity; Tundra","Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Global warming; Biotic interactions; Circumpolar regions; Ecological functioning; Open top chambers; Phenotypic plasticity; Plant performance; Potential effects; Reproductive output; Landforms; alpine environment; climate change; global warming; growth rate; mountain region; open-top chamber; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive biology; tundra; Arctic",Article,Scopus

Most such studies deal with dry, acidic, wet or alpine grassland types, while little is known about changes in mesic grasslands, particularly in urban areas. To investigate the effects of anthropogenic environmental change on such grasslands, we resurveyed a selection of plots in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) approximately 25 years after their original recording. First, we checked whether 241 extensively used mesic grasslands (belonging to the Arrhenatheretalia elatioris) in the city were still grasslands, and whether their management had changed. Then we resurveyed a representative subset of 30 quasi-permanent plots of 50 m2. We tested whether biodiversity metrics, mean ecological indicator values, community weighted means (CWMs) of functional traits or the presence of individual vascular plant species had changed. We found that 15% of the original grasslands had been lost due to changes in land use during this period. Of the remaining grasslands, most of the former meadows were still mown, while many of the former pastures had been transformed into meadows. Measures of alpha diversity had not changed significantly for the 30 plots. However, species composition now indicated nutrient poorer, less base-rich and less ruderal site conditions, while CWMs of specific leaf area (SLA) had decreased and that of seed mass increased. In stands that were managed by mowing in both periods there was practically no change, while there was a pronounced change in those that had been transformed from grazing to mowing. In general, five species showed a significant increase and 16 species a significant decrease in frequency, with no obvious ecological difference between winners and losers. Alien species were rare in both periods and showed hardly any trend, except Veronica persica, which became rarer. In conclusion, more extensively used grasslands have survived to date than would be anticipated in such a rapidly growing city as Zurich. Their quality has hardly changed during the past quarter century, and if changes occurred, they are rather attributable to the intentional change of management from grazing to mowing. The relatively good ecological state of these urban grasslands might be due to a lower agricultural land use pressure than outside urban areas, as well as a constant management of many of these grasslands with a conservation focus. By maintaining these grasslands in their current state, they may have the potential to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in urban areas. © 2021.

Along latitudinal gradients, allocation theory predicts that faster flowering onset at high latitudes results in maturation at smaller size and thus reduced reproductive output. For annual invasive plants, more favourable environmental conditions at low latitudes probably result in stronger competition of co-occurring species, potentially driving selection for higher investment in vegetative biomass, while harsher climatic conditions and associated reproductive uncertainty at higher latitudes could reduce selection for vegetative biomass and increased selection for high reproductive investment (stress-gradient hypothesis). Combined, these drivers could result in increased or constant reproductive allocation with increasing latitude. • Methods We quantified life-history traits in the invasive annual plant Impatiens glandulifera along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. By growing two successive glasshouse generations, we assessed genetic differentiation in vegetative growth and reproductive output across six populations, and tested whether onset of flowering drives this divergence. • Key Results Trait variation was mainly caused by genetic differentiation. As expected, flowering onset was progressively earlier in populations from higher latitudes. Plant height and vegetative biomass also decreased in populations from higher latitudes, as predicted by allocation theory, but their variation was independent of the variation in flowering onset. Reproductive output remained constant across latitudes, resulting in increased reproductive allocation towards higher latitudes, supporting the stress-gradient hypothesis. We also observed trait genetic differentiation among populations that was independent of latitude. • Conclusions We show that an annual invasive plant evolved several life-history traits across its invaded range in ~150 years. The evolution of vegetative and reproductive traits seems unconstrained by evolution of flowering onset. This genetic decoupling between vegetative and reproductive traits possibly contributes to the invasion success of this species. © The Author(s) 2020.

The identification of indicator or diagnostic species is usually performed by summarizing the species abundances within each group of sites. Species with high concentration in a given group of sites are considered diagnostic of that particular group. Among the methods proposed for the determination of indicator species, only very few have considered the species functional traits. This is quite surprising, as species influence ecosystem processes via their traits. Therefore, the species functional traits should give a much better ecological characterization of a group of sites than the species abundances. The aim of this paper is thus to use the species functional characteristics to improve their diagnostic value. These characteristics include the species functional traits and all species-level indicators of environmental association. The proposed method consists of combining the species abundances and their functional characteristics into a single composite index, which can be interpreted as the species fuzzy degree of compatibility with each group of sites. The interpretation of this index in terms of fuzzy set theory allows to introduce a high degree of flexibility in the computation of the species diagnostic values. To show the behavior of the proposed index, two worked examples with data on Alpine vegetation in northern Italy and urban alien species in the city of Brussels (Belgium) are used. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Functional abundance; Functional centroid; Fuzzy sets; Permutation methods; Species occurrences","Computation theory; Ecology; Fuzzy set theory; Degree of flexibility; Diagnostic value; Ecosystem process; Functional characteristics; Functional traits; Indicator species; Single composites; Species abundance; Forestry; abundance; alpine environment; animal community; bioindicator; introduced species; plant community; vegetation type; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Italy; Animalia",Article,Scopus

A pressing question to address is if plant diversity will increase or decrease in this warming world since contradictory pieces of evidence exit of accelerating plant speciation and plant extinction in the Anthropocene. Results: Comparison may be made of the Anthropocene with the past geological times characterised by a warming climate, e.g., the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 55.8 million years ago (Mya) - a period of ""crocodiles in the Arctic"", during which plants saw accelerated speciation through autopolyploid speciation. Three accelerators of plant speciation were reasonably identified in the Anthropocene, including cities, polar regions and botanical gardens where new plant species might be accelerating formed through autopolyploid speciation and hybridization. Conclusions: However, this kind of positive effect of climate warming on new plant species formation would be thoroughly offset by direct and indirect intensive human exploitation and human disturbances that cause habitat loss, deforestation, land use change, climate change, and pollution, thus leading to higher extinction risk than speciation in the Anthropocene. At last, four research directions are proposed to deepen our understanding of how plant traits affect speciation and extinction, why we need to make good use of polar regions to study the mechanisms of dispersion and invasion, how to maximize the conservation of plant genetics, species, and diverse landscapes and ecosystems and a holistic perspective on plant speciation and extinction is needed to integrate spatiotemporally. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anthropocene; Biodiversity; Conservation; Plant extinction; Plant speciation","biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; plant; species differentiation; species extinction; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Genetic Speciation; Greenhouse Effect; Plants",Review,Scopus

Levels of plant defences and herbivore performance might shift under climate warming, particularly in alpine habitats, where herbivore pressure is currently low. Plant responses to warming should be driven by species-specific shifts in physical and chemical defence traits. We investigated the association between plant leaf physical and chemical traits and herbivory under current and warmer climates in three grasslands along a subalpine to alpine gradient. Specifically, we measured the rate of in situ natural herbivory, and performed bioassays to measure overall plant species-level resistance using the extreme generalist non-native caterpillar Spodoptera littoralis. We simulated warmer conditions by using open-top chambers and assessed the effect of warming on leaf physical and chemical traits, and how trait changes affect caterpillar performance. Natural herbivory and caterpillar performance were associated with plant physical traits, including specific leaf area, and with ordination axes representing dimensions of the plant chemical profile. We found that the warming treatment independently decreased the number of distinct chemical compounds per species, and marginally increased specific leaf area. Changes in leaf functional traits were not systematically associated with changes in caterpillar performance. Synthesis. Plant physical traits and chemical profiles are both related to natural herbivory and plant resistance against Spodoptera littoralis. While leaf physical and chemical traits of high elevation plants were modified by the warming treatment, these changes did not result in predictable effects on plant resistance against herbivores. © 2019 The Authors.

We experimentally assessed whether communities assembled under colder climates were inherently more open to recruitment than warmer-climate communities, after controlling for differences in the current climate under which the communities were growing. We then tested whether variation in openness to recruitment could be explained by community biomass or by the plant functional traits of the community. The study was conducted in a climate grid of twelve grassland sites across southern Norway, differing systematically in temperature and precipitation. Along a 2000 mm precipitation gradient, we transplanted turfs with intact plant communities from alpine and sub-alpine sites into 2°C warmer sites, and measured natural seedling emergence in these transplanted turfs versus locally replanted control turfs at the transplant destination sites. Mixed effect models were used to assess the effect of origin (cold versus warm climate), biomass, and functional trait composition of the communities on seedling emergence. We further assessed variation in these effects across different climatic contexts (the temperature and precipitation gradients). Communities originating from colder climates were consistently more open to recruitment, with on average 44% more seedlings emerging, than the locally replanted control communities. The higher rates of seedling emergence in colder-climate communities were attributable to systematic differences in plant functional traits, but not in biomass. The colder-climate communities were composed of species with smaller leaves and lower maximum plant heights; traits that may make these communities less effective at excluding new recruits. These trait-related responses were not significant in the warmest sites and did not very across the precipitation gradient. Our results suggest that alpine species lack the competitive effect traits required to make their communities resistant to invasion by novel competitors under climate change. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos","biomass; biotic interactions; climate change; effect traits; emergence; invasibility","air temperature; alpine environment; biological invasion; biomass; biotic factor; climate change; functional role; plant community; precipitation (climatology); recruitment (population dynamics); seedling; seedling emergence; warming; Norway",Article,Scopus

In addition, three housekeeper genes (tub, actin, tef) were selected for amplification of specific gene fragments in order to construct phylogenetic trees for each housekeeper gene for the endophyte species recovered. The endophyte morphological traits, such as colonisation morphology, hyphal growth rate, spore morphology and size were consistent with the recovered endophytes being Epichloё sp. Phylogenetic trees for tub and actin indicated that endophytes isolated from S. aliena had a close relationship with Epichloё gansuensis and Epichloё sylvatica; however, phylogenetic trees for tef showed that endophytes isolated from S. aliena were closely related to E. gansuensis and E. inebrians. Therefore, the endophytes of S. aliena were preliminarily identified as E. gansuensis from China (Xinjiang), E. inebrians from China (Gansu) and E. sylvatica from Europe.

This paper addresses the hypotheses outlined in the preceding paper: 1) A whole-plant system of modal plant functional types (PFTs) based on a core set of functional traits can provide an improved alternative to PFTs and traits used so far in models of vegetation response to climate change; 2) Modal PFTs are more efficient indicators of vegetation response to climate change than individual traits; 3) Improved plant functional selection criteria can lead to improved parameters in Earth System and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Present-day (1975 centred) plant–climate relationships were analyzed within a global climatic framework of 1327 (200 m2) sample sites covering all major biomes. Five regions were selected for their range of bioclimatic gradients (arctic-boreal; cool temperate-subtropical; humid equatorial; hot, cold deserts). Biophysical site data were recorded along gradient oriented transects (gradsects) using a standard protocol that included all vascular plant taxa and modal PFTs. Regression, ordination and species distribution modeling were used to assess plant–climate indicator values against ten bioclimatic variables including extremes of contemporary thermal, light (energy) and moisture availability and estimates for ‘present’ (1975) and year 2100 climate scenarios. Modal PFTs and individual traits were highly correlated in differing patterns with bioclimate in each of the five regions in both climate scenarios with PFTs being the best predictors. Each of the three hypotheses is supported by these results, indicating that preference should be given to modal assemblages rather than individual traits as response parameters in predictive vegetation models. The indicators identified here are but one element of the highly complex array of other factors that influence vegetation response to terrestrial environmental change such as resource use, species acclimation, invasive species and human population pressure. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Bioclimate; Green stem photosynthesis; Leaf inclination; Leaf stomatal distribution; Modal PFTs; Plant–climate indicators; Species distribution modeling","bioindicator; climate change; ecological modeling; functional role; hypothesis testing; invasive species; light intensity; ordination; photosynthesis; population distribution; stem; stomata; Tracheophyta",Article,Scopus

Advances in conventional breeding and crop domestication have begun to mitigate this issue by increasing varieties and generation of stress-resistant traits. Yet, very few species of legumes have been domesticated and perceived as usable food/feed material, while various wild species remain unknown and underexploited despite the critical global food demand. Besides the existence of a few domesticated species, there is a bottleneck challenge of product acceptability by both farmers and consumers. Therefore, this paper explores farmers’ perceptions, preferences, and the possible utilization of some wild Vigna species of legumes toward their domestication and exploitation. Quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted in a mid-altitude agro-ecological zone (Arusha region) and a high altitude agro-ecological zone (Kilimanjaro region) in Tanzania to obtain the opinions of 150 farmers regarding wild legumes and their uses. The study showed that very few farmers in the Arusha (28%) and Kilimanjaro (26%) regions were aware of wild legumes and their uses. The study further revealed through binary logistic regression analysis that the prior knowledge of wild legumes depended mainly on farmers’ location and not on their gender, age groups, education level, or farming experience. From the experimental plot with 160 accessions of wild Vigna legumes planted and grown up to near complete maturity, 74 accessions of wild Vigna legumes attracted the interest of farmers who proposed various uses for each wild accession. A Χ2 test (likelihood ratio test) revealed that the selection of preferred accessions depended on the farmers’ gender, location, and farming experience. Based on their morphological characteristics (leaves, pods, seeds, and general appearance), farmers perceived wild Vigna legumes as potentially useful resources that need the attention of researchers. Specifically, wild Vigna legumes were perceived as human food, animal feed, medicinal plants, soil enrichment material, and soil erosion-preventing materials. Therefore, it is necessary for the scientific community to consider these lines of farmers’ suggestions before carrying out further research on agronomic and nutritional characteristics toward the domestication of these alien species for human exploitation and decision settings. © 2019 by the authors.

We assess the presence of introduced plant species and their persistence (since the previous survey) in a Canadian subpolar site on the Hudson Bay with a history of human introductions from large-scale grain inputs. Widespread sampling was done to locate all introduced plant species in the Churchill, MB, Canada area. We quantified edaphic variations through soil sampling, and the effect of aspect on introduced species’ richness, cover, and height. At the regional scale, species life history traits and climate envelopes (average and variability of climate in a native range) were established to determine if persistent plant species had similar climate requirements. We found that despite statistically significant warming and increased precipitation, the number of introduced plant species in sub-Arctic Churchill declined from 80 to 36 between the 1989 and 2013 sampling periods. We found that introduced species favor locally warmer, human-disturbed sites with above average soil nutrients. The plant species that remained in Churchill since the 1989 survey compared to those that did not persist are better able to tolerate colder temperatures and have wider, more variable climate envelopes. The decline in introduced species is likely linked to changes in grain shipment inputs. Many of the introduced species recorded in 1989 may have only existed through constant seed subsidies from imports, suggesting that most species have not yet been successful in the absence of human modification. Although the number of introduced plants has decreased, we suggest that continuous disturbance is no longer required for some introduced species to persist suggesting that a climate threshold may have been crossed for some species. One introduced species (Taraxacum officinale, common dandelion) has spread to areas that have not been modified by humans and is now growing in two undisturbed locations. Its current distribution outside disturbed areas does not yet warrant the distinction of invasive at this time. The findings of this study suggest that in the Canadian Arctic, if disturbance and nutrient enrichment are reduced, the potential for introduced plants to establish and possibly become invasive is still limited but will likely change as warming continues. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Arctic; Climate change; Climate envelopes; Invasion; Sub-Arctic; Tundra","biological invasion; boreal forest; climate change; climate effect; global warming; human activity; introduced species; invasive species; plant; population decline; sampling; subarctic region; tundra; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Churchill; Hudson Bay Lowlands; Manitoba; Taraxacum officinale",Article,Scopus

Taking the alpine meadow community in the Zoigê Plateau as a study case, this paper classified PFTs in terms of plant nutrition traits. The sequential results are as follows. (1) The main herbages in the Zoigê Plateau included 16 species in 5 families. Among the five families, Cyperaceae vegetation accounted for 81.37% of herbage area in total, while the remaining 4 families occupied less than 20%. As for the species, Kobresia setchwanensis Hand.-Maizz. was dominant, accounting for 48.74% of the total area; while the remaining 51.26% was comprised of Polygonum viviparum L., Anaphalis fiavescens Hand.-Mazz., Stipa aliena Keng and other species. (2) By using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the assessment of herbages nutrition was carried out based on the comprehensive multi-index evaluation model. Polygonum viviparum L. had the highest nutritional value score (1.43), and Stipa aliena Keng had the lowest (-1.40). Nutritional value of herbage species had a significantly positive correlation with altitude (P<0.01) in the Zoigê Plateau.

By analysing 131,394 occurrence records of 1,334 plant species collected over 20 years in the European Alps, we found that non-natives are spreading upwards approximately twice as fast as natives. Whereas the spread of natives was enhanced by traits favouring longer dispersal distances, this was not the case for non-natives. This was due to the non-native species pool already being strongly biased towards species that had traits facilitating spread. A large proportion of native and non-native species seemed to be able to spread upwards faster than the current velocity of climate change. In particular, long-distance dispersal events and proximity to roads proved to be key drivers for the observed rapid spread. Our findings highlight that invasions by non-native species into native alpine communities are a potentially significant additional pressure on these vulnerable ecosystems that are already likely to suffer dramatic vegetation changes with ongoing warming and increasing human activity in mountain regions. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"alpine environment; anthropogenic effect; biological invasion; climate change; disturbance; human activity; mountain region; native species; nature-society relations; plant community; species pool; vulnerability; Alps",Article,Scopus

The rapid invasion of the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora in China during the last 36 yr is a test case for the roles of these mechanisms. A previous study of S. alterniflora in China found strong latitudinal clines in vegetative and sexual traits and concluded that most of this variation was due to phenotypic plasticity. Recent observations suggested provenance-by-environment interactions, and we employed common gardens at multiple latitudes as a test of this idea. Phenotypically, field plant height, which correlates strongly with biomass and other indices of vegetative performance in this species, showed a hump-shaped relationship across 10 sites, covering 19° of latitude; field seed set increased linearly with latitude. To assess the role of plasticity vs. genetic differentiation in these patterns, we grew plants from the ten field sites in three common gardens at low (20.9° N), mid (28.3° N), and high (38.0° N) latitudes to maturity, at 18 months. Plant height varied among common gardens, with the tallest plants at mid latitude, mirroring the field pattern, consistent with the previous study. Within the gardens, latitude of origin also affected plant height. Seed set varied among the gardens, with the greatest values at high latitudes, again mirroring the field pattern and indicating substantial plasticity. Evidence of evolution was found as increasing seed set with latitude among provenances within common gardens. However, the effect differed among common gardens, with the greatest slope in the high-latitude garden, lower slope in the mid-latitude garden, and no relationship in the low-latitude garden, indicating a provenance-by-environment interaction. The number of surviving plants also suggested a provenance-by-environment interaction; no relationship with latitude among provenances in the two southern gardens and increasing survival with latitude in the northern garden. Field seedling density was ~200-fold greater at high than at low latitude sites. The profuse seed germination and recruitment in the north could have created high selection intensity resulting in evolution of reproductive traits at high latitudes with the result that the mechanisms of the invasion differ with latitude. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","biological invasion; genetic differentiation; latitudinal cline; pre-adaptation; provenance-by-environment interaction; recruitment; sexual reproduction; Spartina alterniflora","biological invasion; cline; environmental effect; genetic differentiation; grass; latitudinal gradient; phenotypic plasticity; recruitment (population dynamics); reproductive status; sexual reproduction; survival; China; Spartina alterniflora; acclimatization; China; genetics; genotype environment interaction; phenotype; physiology; Poaceae; Acclimatization; China; Gene-Environment Interaction; Phenotype; Poaceae",Article,Scopus

Current hypotheses propose an elevated impact of those environmental changes on the biodiversity, community composition and metabolic processes of species. The effects on ecosystem function and services, particularly when invasive or toxigenic harmful species become dominant, can be expressed over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in plankton communities. Our study focused on the comparison of molecular biodiversity of three size-fractions (micro-, nano-, picoplankton) in the coastal pelagic zone of West Greenland and their association with environmental parameters. Molecular diversity was assessed via parallel amplicon sequencing the 28S rRNA hypervariable D1/D2 region. We showed that biodiversity distribution within the area of Uummannaq Fjord, Vaigat Strait and Disko Bay differed markedly within and among size-fractions. In general, we observed a higher diversity within the picoplankton size fraction compared to the nano- and microplankton. In multidimensional scaling analysis, community composition of all three size fractions correlated with cell size, silicate and phosphate, chlorophyll a (chl a) and dinophysistoxin (DTX). Individually, each size fraction community composition also correlated with other different environmental parameters, i.e. temperature and nitrate. We observed a more homogeneous community of the picoplankton across all stations compared to the larger size classes, despite different prevailing environmental conditions of the sampling areas. This suggests that habitat niche occupation for larger-celled species may lead to higher functional trait plasticity expressed as an enhanced range of phenotypes, whereas smaller organisms may compensate for lower potential plasticity with higher diversity.

In the absence of specialist herbivores, it is believed that invasive plants may allocate fewer resources to resistance and more to growth and reproduction, thus increasing tolerance to damage in the invasive genotypes. In order to test these predictions, we compared both performance (growth and reproduction) and defense strategies (tolerance and resistance) of two populations of Taraxacum officinale, one from the native range in the French Alps, and one from the introduced range in the Chilean Andes. Individuals from the introduced population demonstrated improved reproductive traits relative to those from the native population, although there was no discernible difference in biomass accumulation. Additionally, reduced tolerance was evident in the case of the former; whereas fitness traits of native plants were unaffected by damage, invasive plants reduced growth and seed output by 25 and 30% respectively following damage treatments. Increases in levels of phenols and anthocyanins, produced as a defense response to herbivory, were observed in introduced plants. Our results suggest that reallocation of resources to reproduction may be an important factor favouring invasive success of T. officinale in Chile, and that a higher investment in chemical resistance traits in this population may also be a factor in this regard. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biological invasion; Damage; Dandelion; EICA; Resistance; Tolerance","alpine environment; biological invasion; fitness; herb; herbivore; investment; life history trait; plant defense; reproductive success; resource allocation; specialist; stress resistance; tolerance; Alps; Andes; Chile; France; Taraxacum officinale",Article,Scopus

An urgent question is whether native herbivores are able to inhibit the spread of these alien species thus providing biotic resistance. The potential for biotic resistance to these plants depends on plant traits that affect palatability to herbivores, i.e., plant nutritional quality and the presence of secondary metabolites related to anti-herbivory defenses. Studies across latitudinal gradients suggest that aquatic plants from lower latitudes may be less nutritious and better defended than high latitude plants. Therefore, we hypothesized that native herbivores prefer temperate plants over plants from tropical and subtropical regions which would limit the strength of biotic resistance that native temperate herbivores can provide against alien tropical and subtropical plants. Drawing upon the published literature we (1) investigated whether native temperate herbivores reduce the establishment or performance of tropical and subtropical alien plants in the field, and (2) analyzed herbivore consumption of tropical and subtropical versus temperate plants in laboratory feeding trials. In our literature survey, we found only three field studies which, in contrast to our hypothesis, all demonstrated that the native herbivores (beavers, coots or generalist insect herbivores) significantly reduced the success of invading tropical and subtropical plant species. The analysis of the feeding trials yielded mixed results. Ten out of twelve feeding trials showed that (sub)tropical and temperate plants were consumed in equal amounts by both temperate and tropical generalist ectothermic herbivores. The remaining trials showed higher consumption rate of both temperate and tropical plants by tropical snails. Although a body of evidence suggests that tropical plants are nutritionally poor and better defended (i.e., less palatable) compared to temperate plants, we conclude that in the majority of cases, herbivores would eat tropical plants as much as temperate plants. Thus, in agreement with the available field studies, evidence suggests that there is potential for biotic resistance from native generalist herbivores to tropical invasive plants in non-tropical areas. © 2017 The Author(s).

Essential to predicting the consequences of climate change to individual species will be an understanding of the factors that drive genetic structure within and among populations. Here, I review the factors that influence the genetic structure of plant species in California, but are applicable elsewhere; existing levels of genetic variation, life history and ecological characteristics will affect the ability of an individual taxon to persist in the presence of anthropogenic change. • Factors influencing the distribution of genetic variation: Persistence in the face of climate change is likely determined by life history characteristics: dispersal ability, generation time, reproductive ability, degree of habitat specialization, plant-insect interactions, existing genetic diversity and availability of habitat or migration corridors. Existing levels of genetic diversity in plant populations vary based on a number of evolutionary scenarios that include endemism, expansion since the last glacial maximum, breeding system and current range sizes. • Regional priorities and examples: A number of well-documented examples are provided from the California Floristic Province. Some predictions can be made for the responses of plant taxa to rapid environmental changes based on geographic position, evolutionary history, existing genetic variation, and ecological amplitude. • Conclusions, Solutions and Recommendations: The prediction of how species will respond to climate change will require a synthesis drawing from population genetics, geography, palaeontology and ecology. The important integration of the historical factors that have shaped the distribution and existing genetic structure of California's plant taxa will enable us to predict and prioritize the conservation of species and areas most likely to be impacted by rapid climate change, human disturbance and invasive species. © The Author 2016.

Our work focused on whether the tempo and trajectory of successional development described in the original study have changed over this period during which summer temperatures warmed by approximately 2°C. Our work revealed a rapid increase in the distribution, stature, and abundance of balsam poplar trees that was unanticipated in the original successional model alongside evidence that established late-successional plant communities have changed relatively little over the same time period. The spatial distribution of poplar expansion was both directional and highly variable, with greater expansion occurring in sites that were young surfaces in 1958, or else were disturbed during the intervening period. We present evidence that early successional environments in this region may be particularly susceptible to rapid alteration stimulated by climate warming that has allowed tree establishment and growth in subalpine areas. Sparsely vegetated sites allow for invasion or expansion of some species to be quickly realized because there is less resistance from competition with established vegetation, including mosses that insulate and paludify the soil. We suggest that established vegetation communities may have physical characteristics (such as cold and/or acidic soil profiles) that are inimical to the establishment of balsam poplar and may also be a source of competitive inertia, conferring a measure of resistance to directional changes in the landscape mosaic. However, when an early successional species has traits that allow it to persist and fundamentally alter the vegetation mosaic over time, as is the case with balsam poplar, it may serve as the leading edge of compositional changes with profound consequences. Our results highlight the capacity of a single species to catalyze the changes that may eventually lead to the altering of an entire landscape mosaic. © 2016 Roland et al.","Alaska; Climate change; Denali National Park; Ecological succession; Populus balsamifera; Shrub tundra; Soil temperature; Special Feature: Science for Our National Parks' Second Century; Vegetation change",,Article,Scopus

The Sierra Nevada has been heavily impacted for more than a century and a half, first by heavy grazing up into high elevation meadows, followed by major logging, and finally, by impacts associated with recreational use. The comparative elevational patterns of distribution and growth form were compared for native and alien plant species in the four families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae) that contribute the majority of naturalized aliens in the study area. The distribution of realized climatic niche breadth, as measured by elevational range of occurrence, was virtually identical for alien and native species, with both groups showing a roughly Gaussian distribution peaking with species whose range covers a span of 1500-1999 m. In contrast to alien species, which only rarely occurred at higher elevations, native species showed a distribution of upper elevation limits peaking at 3000-3499 m, an elevation that corresponds to the zone of upper montane and subalpine forests. Consistent with a hypothesis of abiotic limitations, only a few alien species have been ecologically successful invaders at subalpine and alpine elevations above 2500 m. The low diversity of aliens able to become established in these habitats is unlikely due to dispersal limitations, given the long history of heavy grazing pressure at high elevations across this region. Instead, this low diversity is hypothesized to be a function of life history traits and multiple abiotic stresses that include extremes of cold air and soil temperature, heavy snowfall, short growing seasons, and low resource availability.

The spread of invasive species over large geographic ranges may be facilitated if plants can match their phenotype to local abiotic conditions. Spartina alterniflora, native to the United States, was introduced into China in 1979 and has spread over 19° of latitude along the eastern coast of China. We studied patterns in vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of S. alterniflora at 22 sites at 11 geographic locations over a latitudinal gradient of 2000 km from Tanggu (39.05°N, high latitude) to Leizhou (20.90°N, low latitude) in China. We further evaluated the basis of phenotypic differences by growing plants from across the range in a common garden for 2 growing seasons. We found distinct latitudinal clines in plant height, shoot density and sexual reproduction across latitude. Some traits exhibited linear relationships with latitude; others exhibited hump-shaped relationships. We identified correlations between plant traits and abiotic conditions such as mean annual temperature, growing degree days, tidal range and soil nitrogen content. However, geographic variation in all but one trait disappeared in the common garden, indicating that variation largely due to phenotypic plasticity. Only a slight tendency for latitudinal variation in seed set persisted for 2 years in the common garden, suggesting that plants may be evolving genetic clines for this trait. Synthesis. The rapid spread of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) in China has probably been facilitated by phenotypic plasticity in growth and reproductive traits. We found little evidence for the evolution of genetic clines in China, even though these exist for some traits in the native range. The considerable variation among clones, within provenances, that persisted in the common garden suggests a potential for the evolution of geographic clines in the future. Low fecundity of low-latitude S. alterniflora populations in China might result in a slower spread at low latitudes, but S. alterniflora is likely to continue to spread rapidly at high latitudes in China and into the Korean peninsula.

Trails can damage plants that facilitate the establishment and growth of other species leading to changes in community and functional composition. This can be a particular concern in harsh alpine ecosystems where plant communities are often dominated by one or two keystone species that provide shelter to a suite of beneficiary species. We analysed how a hiking trail affects interspecific facilitation by a dominant trampling-sensitive nurse shrub in the highest National Park in Australia. First we assessed the effects of the trail on the abundance, size and density of the nurse shrub at different distances from the trail. We then compared species richness and composition between areas in, and out, of the nurse shrub's canopy at different distances from the trail. To better understand why some species may benefit from facilitation and any effects of the trail on the quality of facilitation we compared functional composition between quadrats using community trait weighted means calculated by combining plant composition with species functional traits (canopy height, leaf area, % dry weight of leaves and specific leaf area). The abundance, size and density of nurse shrubs was lower on the trail edges than further away, particularly on the leeward edge, where there was more bare ground and less shrub cover. There were differences in species richness, cover, composition and functional composition in and outside the nurse shrub canopy. The shrubs appeared to facilitate species with more competitive, but less stress tolerant traits (e.g. taller plants with leaves that were larger, had high specific leaf area and low dry matter content). However, despite reductions in nurse shrubs near the trail, where they do exist, they appear to provide the same 'quality' of facilitation as nurse shrubs further away. However, longer-term effects may be occurring as the loss of nurse shrubs alters the wind profile of the ridgeline and therefore succession. The use of a steel mesh walkway along the trail may facilitate the regeneration of nurse shrubs and other plants that require protection from wind. Our results highlight the importance of diversifying recreation ecology research to assess how trails affect important ecological processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecological processes; Ecosystem functioning; Inter-specific interactions; Tourism and recreation; Windswept Feldmark","alpine environment; biological invasion; ecosystem function; facilitation; growth rate; interspecific interaction; keystone species; national park; plant community; recreational activity; shrub; Article; Australia; building; canopy; competitive ability; controlled study; density; dry weight; environmental impact; environmental stress; facilitation; hiking trail; keystone species; leaf area; national park; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant stress; shrub; species richness; tourism; ecosystem; environment; physiology; plant physiology; recreation; Australia; Australia; Ecosystem; Environment; Plant Leaves; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Recreation",Article,Scopus

Variations of leaf traits were common along an altitudinal gradient at species level, but with different trends between two species. The relationships between plant functional traits were complex and showed different patterns between two species. Two species show different response patterns and adaptation strategies to environmental gradients. The Qa at high altitude suffers from low temperature stress that breaks its carbon balance and leads to growth restriction, which supports the “source-limitation” hypothesis, while Qs at high altitude possesses an adequate supply of carbon to protect from stress, which supports the “sink- or growth-limitation” hypothesis.

J.P. Grime’s theory on CSR strategies of plants indicate whether plant species is a good competitor, adapted to disturbance or to limited resources. Te goal of this study was to fnd which CSR strategy (if any) prevails among invasive plants in Croatia. Materials and Methods: Data on CSR strategies were not available, or not consistent, for all invasive plants in Croatia, hence we have allocated CSR strategies to 15 invasive taxa, using the methodology based on several plant traits, which resulted in assignment of CSR type to 57 invasive plants. Distributional records of those 57 taxa in Croatia from the Flora Croatica Database were used to analyse the occurrence of invasive plants among three biogeographical regions (Alpine, Continental and Mediterranean). Results and Conclusions: In total, 10 CSR types were found among the invasive plants of Croatia, mostly CR-strategists, followed by C-strate-gists and R-strategists. Te largest proportion of R-strategists was found in the Mediterranean region, while the largest proportion of C-strategists was found in the Alpine region. Out of the three main strategies, competitive ability and ruderality were found to be frequently present within the Croatian invasive fora, while stress tolerance was almost absent. © 2014, Croatian Society of Natural Sciences.

Surprisingly, a number of successful establishments have been documented, although mainly from Mediterranean to tropical mountain systems. Evidence for alpine invaders in temperate mountain environments is scarce, increasing the importance to better understand their invasion process and mechanisms. This study characterizes the habitat of the Central Asian poppy, Papaver croceum, in its introduced range and compares it with a native congener, Papaver aurantiacum, in the subalpine and alpine zone of the Upper Engadine, Switzerland. Vegetation composition and soil characteristics were measured at P. croceum and P. aurantiacum sites in the Upper Engadine region. P. croceum is best characterized as a pioneer species preferring anthropogenic and naturally disturbed habitats on silicate soils ranging between 1,700 and 2,300 m asl in the study area. Species composition, Landolt indicator values for light availability, soil nitrogen and temperature as well as certain soil properties differed significantly between the sites colonized by native and exotic poppy species, although an overlapping zone exists in glacier forefield habitats of the study area. P. croceum did not express typical traits and characteristics of a disruptive invader. In the Morteratsch glacier forefield, however, it has invaded the primary successional stages but is outcompeted in later stages. Presently, a clear ecological separation is apparent between the native and alien congener indicating limited threat to the native congener. However, climate change, land use change and possible hybridization might alter P. croceum's current status as a non-disruptive invader. © 2013 Swiss Botanical Society.","Biological invasion; High-elevation ecosystem; Mountain invasion; Papaver aurantiacum; Papaver croceum; Swiss Alps","alpine environment; biological invasion; climate change; colonization; community composition; dicotyledon; elevation; habitat selection; hybridization; invasive species; land use change; light availability; mountain region; native species; pioneer species; population distribution; silicate; soil nitrogen; Alps; Engadin; Graubunden; Switzerland; Papaver; Papaver nudicaule",Article,Scopus

Location: Three research sites in the continental inland of West Greenland. Methods: Based on spatially constrained clustering of 147 vegetation relevés and 145 transect plots of plant communities, boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were assessed. Indicators for altitudinal sections were identified from 664 vegetation relevés among vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and plant functional types using indicator species analysis. The performance of different plant groups along the altitudinal gradient was visualized with response curves. Results: Boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were detected at 400, 800 and 1175 m a.s.l. on north-facing slopes and at 450, 900 and 1250 m a.s.l. on south-facing slopes. The resulting four vegetation belts were well defined by 99 indicator species and nine indicator plant functional types. Species, plant functional types and vascular plant distribution types showed clear sequences along the altitudinal gradient, which partly resemble their distribution along the latitudinal gradient. Conclusions: As an easily observable expansion of shrubs and a decline of mosses and lichens is expected, the boundary at 400/450 m a.s.l. is particularly promising for climate change monitoring. The anticipated replacement of numerous cryophilous by thermophilous indicator species, as well as an obvious shift of plant functional types suggest several monitoring options at 800/900 m a.s.l. The summit areas above 1175/1250 m a.s.l., having a discontinuous plant cover, are considered to be especially vulnerable to fast invasion by species of lower altitudes such as woody plants and sedges. Due to steep gradients and short migration distances in mountains, it can be assumed that these anticipated changes in the study area will be stronger and faster than the already observed changes along the latitudinal gradient in lowland areas of the Arctic. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Bryophytes; Global warming; Lichens; Migration; Plant functional types; Vascular plants","Bryophyta; bryophytes; Carex; Tracheophyta",Article,Scopus

High-mountain habitats have been particularly useful for evaluation of the relative importance of environmental conditions in the colonization and invasion process, because they have heterogeneous and stressful climatic conditions, inducing photoinhibition. Light intensity is one of the most changing conditions along altitudinal gradients, showing more variability in higher altitudes. In this study, we analyzed the plasticity in photoprotective strategies and performance of the invasive Taraxacum officinale. Additionally, we tested whether higher plasticity enhances competitive ability in an alpine environment We conducted an experiment to evaluate plasticity with a second generation (F2) of T. officinale individuals from 1,600 to 3,600 m, in a greenhouse with variation in light intensity. Treatments consisted of transferring 120 individuals from each altitude to two conditions of light intensity. We then recorded concentrations of photoprotection pigment, de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle, foliar angles, photochemical efficiency by fluorescence of photosystem II, total dry biomass and flower production. Additionally, we compared plasticity in both photoprotective and performance traits between T. officinale and the co-occurring native species Hypochaeris thrincioides. Finally, we performed a manipulative experiment under two light regimes in order to assess the competitive outcome between the invasive T. officinale and the native H. thrincioides. Individuals from higher altitude showed significantly greater plasticity than individuals from lower altitude. Similarly, individuals under high light intensity showed higher levels of photoprotective pigments, biomass and flower production. On the other hand, the invasive plant species showed significantly greater plasticity than the co-occurring native species, and a strong negative impact on the biomass of the native plant. Phenotypic plasticity seems to be a successful strategy in T. officinale to compete with native species and may be positively associated with the success of invasions, being greater in individuals from more heterogeneous and stressful environments. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Altitudinal gradient; Competition; Fluorescence; Light intensity; Photoprotective pigments; Xanthophyll cycle","altitudinal zonation; colonization; dicotyledon; ecophysiology; flower; fluorescence; invasive species; light intensity; phenotypic plasticity; photoinhibition; photoprotection; phytomass; pigment; Hypochaeris thrincioides; Taraxacum officinale",Article,Scopus

In the Italian Alps, we studied plant diversity, forage value and trophic traits in six large-scale heterogeneously grazed Nardus pastures, in their central and peripheral parts, and across the montane, lower and upper subalpine zones. Seventy cover-abundance floristic relevés were performed in randomly located permanent plots, half at the pasture edge (M-plots) and half in their central part (C-plots). Plant diversity varied significantly with respect to the distance from the edge, being higher in M-plots because of shrub invasion as a consequence of reduced cattle pressure. Nardus cover was slightly higher in C-plots and negatively related to plant diversity. Forage value was lower in M-plots and negatively correlated with the cover of Nardus and woody species, implying that different grazing pressure was negatively influencing sward productivity. Differences in trophic traits of swards between C- and M-plots existed mostly as trends. Forage value significantly decreased in the lower subalpine and montane pastures, which are further grazed in late summer.

Some invasive plant species are among the most widely distributed plants worldwide. Plasticity and local adaptation could be the mechanisms for colonising new areas. Aims:We addressed if Taraxacum officinale from native (Alps) and introduced (Andes) stock responded similarly to drought treatment, in terms of photosynthesis, foliar angle, and flowering time. We also evaluated if ontogeny affected fitness and physiological responses to drought. Methods:We carried out two common garden experiments with both seedlings and adults (F2) of T. officinale from its native and introduced ranges in order to evaluate their plasticity and ecotypic differentiation under a drought treatment. Results: Our data suggest that the functional response of T. officinale individuals from the introduced range to drought is the result of local adaptation rather than plasticity.

The floristic characteristics of the different environments have been analyzed both in general as well as compared to the species of conservation interest. In this regard it has been noted that herbaceous habitats, particularly dry grasslands, those at high altitudes and rocky environments contain the highest conservation value as they contain more than half of the relevant plants. The single environment that contains the largest number of species of conservation interest (30%) is, however, the mesophilic wood environment and this further confirms the importance of the forest flora of the Park. Finally, it is pointed out that this check-list has to be considered a useful starting point, which can be implemented and improved, for the knowledge of the vascular flora of this marvellous territory and certainly not an end result.","Central Italy; Chorology; Conservation; Foreste Casentinesi National Park; Northern Apennines; Vascular flora",,Article,Scopus

The mid-latitude var. lancifolia generally showed intermediate growth vigor. Regarding allocation, var. obtusifolia allocated a distinctly higher proportion of biomass to storage roots and leaves, whereas var. acutifolia and var. lancifolia allocated more biomass to stems. This pattern of variation might be the outcome of evolutionary differentiation in response to their geographic distributions and local habitats.

Furthermore, there is little consensus as to whether a plastic response is related to invasiveness in stressful environments. Exotic species have recently been reported in the high Andes of central Chile, where individuals have to cope with drought and poor soils, in addition to extreme temperatures. We explored if the exotic species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) has plastic responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability, and whether two sets of alpine populations derived from native and introduced populations can converge to similar plastic responses to environmental constraints. Using a common garden approach, we compared plants grown from seeds collected in alpine populations of its native range (Alps, France) and in alpine populations of its introduced range (Andes, Chile) under a drought experiment, a potassium gradient, and a nitrogen gradient. Plasticity was only found as a response to drought. Moreover, different responses were found between both origins. Andean individuals are drought-resistant, while individuals from the Alps were drought-sensitive. According to the nutrient experiments, Andean dandelions behave as a nitrogen demanding-potassium avoiding species, whereas individuals from the Alps did not show any particular dependency or repulsion tendency to either of these two nutrients. Results suggest that differences in life history traits of both derived sets of populations may have an important role in determining the response of dandelions under the evaluated conditions. However, the relative importance of genetic adaptation in these responses is still unclear. Although T. officinale is a cosmopolite weed, this is the first study that compares individuals coming from its native and invaded range under stressful conditions. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Asteraceae; Biological invasions; Common garden; Environmental stress; Exotic species","alpine environment; biological invasion; environmental impact; environmental stress; experimental study; herb; moisture content; nutrient availability; physiological response; Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Asteraceae; Taraxacum lyratum; Taraxacum officinale",Article,Scopus

The basic hypothesis is that an extensive cattle grazing of its habitats (flood meadows) provides an optimum disturbance regime for long-term persistence of the species. Spatial and temporal scales of the investigation were adapted to the dimensions of the most prominent disturbance impacts (rotation grazing and hoof trampling by cattle) and response rates of Apium which are mainly controlled by stolon propagation. A total of 603 microplots, each measuring 10 cm×10 cm, were arranged within three transects and surveyed for two seasons. Statistical analyses include spatial second order statistics and mixed linear models. Random Apium extinctions during grazing periods and fast re-invasions of gaps during subsequent resting periods result in strong population fluctuations. The probability of re-invasion depends on the distance to next Apium plant which must not exceed much more than 1 dm. The morphological plasticity of stolon length indicates presence of ""foraging behaviour"" which facilitates the preoccupation of favourable gaps. Disturbances favour the coexistence of A. repens in the pasture due to a combined effect of reduced shoot competition (destruction of tall competitors) and more efficient ""foraging"" strategies. Attempts to explain Apium coexistence in these flood meadows must take into account both the fine-tuned balance between different disturbance parameters and corresponding functional plants traits. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

There are only 8 common weeds in the Snowy Mountains: Acetosella vulgaris (also known as Rumex acetosella), Hypochaeris radicata, Trifolium repens, Taraxacum officinale, Agrostis capillaris, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Achillea millefolium. They occur in areas disturbed by humans, such as along roadsides and around buildings and tracks, from the low-altitude montane zone to the high-altitude high subalpine/alpine zone. They also occur to varying extents in undisturbed native vegetation, reflecting their invasive capacity. These species are all perennial, with high vegetative and/or sexual reproduction, native to Europe, and are found growing on roadsides and in native vegetation in mountains in Europe, North America, South America, and New Zealand. Therefore, it appears that these plants are the usual suspects: common mountain weeds, which may be found worldwide at high altitude.","Australia; Disturbance; Exotics; Impacts of tourism; Snowy Mountains; Weeds","disturbance; mountain region; population distribution; range size; roadside environment; weed; Australasia; Australia; Australian Alps; Snowy Mountains; Achillea; Achillea millefolium; Agrostis; Agrostis capillaris; Anthoxanthum odoratum; Dactylis; Dactylis glomerata; Hypochaeris radicata; Rumex; Rumex acetosella; Taraxacum officinale; Trifolium repens",Article,Scopus

Environmental light and oxygen concentrations appeared to be the main factors influencing larval attachment, a dark anoxic environment being significantly more favourable.

Structure, floristic composition and invasibility of the plant communities and attributes of the invasive species were studied. To determine the plant characteristics correlated with invasiveness, we distinguished between roadside invaders, native community invaders and non-invasive exotic species, and compared these groups across a range of traits including functional group, taxonomic affinity, life history, mating system and morphology. Poa grasslands and Eucalyptus-Poa woodlands contained the largest number of exotic species, although all communities studied appeared resilient to invasion by most species. Most community invaders were broad-leaved herbs while roadside invaders contained both herbs and a range of grass species. Over the entire study area the richness and cover of native and exotic herbaceous species were positively related, but exotic herbs were more negatively related to cover of specific functional groups (e.g. trees) than native herbs. Compared with the overall pool of exotic species, those capable of invading native plant communities were disproportionately polycarpic, Asteracean and cross-pollinating. Our data support the hypothesis that strong ecological filtering of exotic species generates an exotic assemblage containing few dominant species and which functionally converges on the native assemblage. These findings contrast with those observed in the majority of invaded natural systems. We conclude that the invasion of closed sub-alpine communities must be viewed in terms of the unique attributes of the invading species, the structure and composition of the invaded communities and the strong extrinsic physical and climatic factors typical of the sub-alpine environment.","Community invisibility; Community structure; Diversity relationship; Functional group; Grassland; Roadside; Trait convergence; Woodland","biological invasion; community structure; functional group; grassland; invasibility; plant community; roadside environment; subalpine environment; woodland; Australasia; Australia; Asteraceae; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus; Poa; Poa",Article,Scopus

Both the leaves and roots of the low altitude plants were enriched in 15N relative to the plants of higher altitude, indicating that the low-N set of traits is associated with a more closed N cycle at high altitude. A second independent set of correlations shows that plants of wetter habitats have lower photosynthetic water use efficiency (more negative ∂13C) and lower leaf and root tissue density than the plants of drier sites. For both leaves and roots, plants of native species consistently had traits associated with lower resource availability: lower N concentrations, denser tissues, more negative ∂15N, and more positive ∂13C than non-native species. If root %N is correlated with root longevity as has been shown in other systems, root longevity may be able to be predicted from simple measurements of leaf %N, though a hysteresis in the relationship between leaf and root N concentrations may make prediction of high longevity roots difficult.","Nitrogen; Tissue density; Water use efficiency; ∂15Nitrogen","altitude; covariance analysis; grass; introduced species; leaf; native species; nitrogen; root; water use efficiency; New Zealand; Poaceae",Article,Scopus

Here we present the conceptual basis for experiments focused on manipulating clonal attributes in a community context to determine how clonal characteristics affect interactions among plants at both the individual and community levels. All treatments are replicated at low and high density in a community density series to compare plant responses in environments of different competitive intensity. We examine clonal integration, the sharing of resources among ramets, by severing ramets from one another and comparing their response to ramets with intact connections. Ramet aggregation, the spacing of ramets relative to each other, is investigated by comparing species that differ in their natural aggregation (either clumped growth forms, with ramets tightly packed together, or runner growth forms; with ramets loosely spread) and by planting individual ramets of all species evenly spaced throughout a mesocosm. We illustrate how to test predictions to examine the influence of these two clonal traits on competitive interactions at the individual and community levels. To evaluate the effect of clonal integration on competition, we test two predictions: at the individual level, species with greater clonal integration will be better individual-level competitors, and at the community level, competition will cause a greater change in community composition when ramets are integrated (connected) than when they are not. For aggregation we test at the individual level: clumped growth forms are better competitors than runner growth forms because of their ability to resist invasion, and at the community level: competition will have a greater effect on community structure when ramets are evenly planted. An additional prediction connects the individual- and community-level effects of competition: resistance ability better predicts the effects of competition on relative abundance in a community than does invasion ability. We discuss additional experimental design considerations as revealed by our ongoing studies. Examining how clonal attributes affect both the individual- and community-level effects of competition requires new methods and metrics such as those presented here, and is vital to understanding the role of clonality in community structure of many ecosystems.","Clonal integration; Community; Competition; Ramet aggregation","aggregation; clonal organism; community structure; competition (ecology); plant community; ramet",Conference Paper,Scopus

Establishment conditions were improved with biodegradable wood-fiber mats and a small addition of garden soil. Transplant survival rates were generally good after 12 years. The regeneration of mixed stands was clearly recognizable because some transplants successfully reproduced by seed, and colonizers immigrated from the adjacent natural vegetation and neighboring restoration plots. Comparative studies of reproductive parameters in transplants and their donor population revealed that differences in seed production may become nonsignificant within a short time span. These fitness features have important diagnostic value for assessing restoration success and provide information on the performance of the same or closely related genotypes in their natural populations and in the restoration site. The plants studied showed species-specific traits in establishment after transplanting. Most species can be recommended for restoration in the alpine vegetation belt. The risk of restoration failure can be considerably reduced by using species with different life-history characteristics.

Location: The New Zealand archipelago. Methods: An analysis of the factors correlated with distribution and endemism for alpine plants within New Zealand, and for the New Zealand biota as a whole. Results: Woody plants are highly endemic; nonendemic plants tend to be herbaceous and are concentrated among the highly dispersible ferns and fern allies, orchids and wetland plants. These groups make up 32% of the total flora but contribute 78% of nonendemics. Alpine plants with wide spatial distribution tend to have greater altitudinal ranges, a broader habitat preference and better dispersal ability. Main conclusions: Most vascular plants reached New Zealand by long-distance transoceanic dispersal, probably during the Late Miocene to early Pleistocene period. During the Miocene and Pliocene, similar climates and landscapes to those of Australia and northern island groups, and highly invasible terrain, permitted dispersal of woody plants. Cooling climates and formation of a more mountainous, more compact landscape after that time reduced dispersal of woody plants and favoured herbaceous, wetland and highly dispersible plant groups. The prominence of dispersal has led to intense selective immigration, and is responsible for many characteristic features of the flora. Species selection by glacial-interglacial cycles has restricted acquisition or retention of cool or arid climate adaptations, particularly in the lowland flora. Endemic and range disjunction patterns in the New Zealand mainland are not, in general, directly caused by Pliocene inundations or the faulting and associated horizontal displacement of terrain that has continued since the Miocene. They have arisen mainly through Pleistocene extinctions, speciation and dispersal, and some patterns are strongly linked to repeated glaciation. Endemic centres are associated with differentiated terrain and climates providing isolation, distinctive environments, and habitat continuity conducive to speciation.","Alpine plants; Biogeography; Dispersal; Endemism; New Zealand; Vascular plants","endemism; flora; population distribution; vascular plant; New Zealand",Conference Paper,Scopus

Although alpine areas across the American West showed the effects of too much grazing, logging and mining, Utah's mountains may have been hit hardest. In 1907, when Manti National Forest rangers began reforesting parts of the Wasatch Plateau, and five years later when pioneer range scientist Arthur Sampson and his assistants began regrassing some of its meadows, these managers restored by a process much like gardening, or perhaps farming. They tilled the mountainside, planted exotic species, and established tree plantations. But fifty years later, Sampson's followers restored desirable traits by a process that might be called ""naturalizing"": whenever possible, they scattered native seeds within stablished biological ranges, hoping to conserve soils even more than to grow forage. Manti Forest managers first restored according to human expectations; later they restored according to natural constraints. Initially, they favored cultural remedies to fix a land not recovering on its own; fifty years later they promoted remedies more like those they observed in nature. These restorationists began naturalizing instead of gardening, once they decided that nature, not culture, had more power to repair degraded land. Not just in Utah but across the western U.S. and North America, more and more restorationists believed that land should include greater degrees of wildness. Their restored landscapes soon reflected this new goal of ""rewilding."" Utah's restorationists at first left indelible traces and human artifacts on the mountain, but by mid-century they were designing their alterations to better reflect and recreate a wild mountain. The restoration of Utah's mountainsides is a microcosm of how greater numbers of Americans were promoting nature rather than culture on their land.",,"environmental restoration; restoration ecology; twentieth century; wilderness area; United States; Utah",Article,Scopus

When compared to other plants which tend to monopolize space, F. sachalinensis appears to have a life cycle characterized by an early seasonal development. It exhibits a high growth rate - ca. 4 to 5 cm/day, and its productivity is associated with intrinsic characteristics of the species: abundant leaf cover, the appearance of branches when the leaves reach an optimal size on the main stem, and favorable leaf orientation to capture high light intensity. Another morphological characteristic is the presence of a large medullary air cell containing a liquid rich in mineral salts which can be used by the plant when the demand for evaporation increases. Clonal spread associated with an extraordinarily high rate of proliferation of below-ground organs, and mechanisms for adaptation to adverse conditions are biological traits rendering F. sachalinensis an invader in alluvial plains along alpine rivers.

Except where surface erosion is severe, natural succession can proceed quite rapidly, and sowing of exotic grasses is likely to inhibit rather than promote the establishment of native plants. Revegetation of xeric disturbed sites is often restricted by inadequate supplies of seed, nitrogen and/or water.
