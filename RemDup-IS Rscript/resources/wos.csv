Although plant responses in tundra and alpine environments from high latitudes have been well-studied at the community level, the overall effect of warming on global alpine plant populations and species remains unclear. We collated global data from 46 open-top chamber (OTC) studies conducted on alpine plants from mountain belts worldwide and assessed potential effects of warming on plant performance. In addition, we examined warming responses of plants from the tundra zone (Arctic tundra and alpine tundra) in circumpolar regions. In terms of growth and reproductive output, the overall response of 91 plant species was highly positive. Shrubs grew significantly larger and expressed higher reproduction under warming compared to forbs and graminoids. Arctic tundra plants tended to respond more positively to warming compared to alpine tundra plants. We also found that plant responses were greater with increasing precipitation across circumpolar tundra, but not across alpine zones. Phenotypic plasticity in size- and fitness-related traits were similar for both alpine and tundra zones. Our findings support the notion that global warming can cause significant changes to alpine environments. Due to changes in biotic interactions, alpine tundra plants may be more negatively affected by warming compared to Arctic tundra plants which responded more positively to warming. Similarly, if shrubs are most advantaged under warming, their invasion into higher elevations may threaten the ecological functioning of alpine ecosystems, which is another serious challenge from climate change.","[Fazlioglu, Fatih] Ordu Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Fac Arts & Sci, TR-52200 Ordu, Turkey; [Wan, Justin S.

Plants of high altitude sites have low N concentrations in both their leaves and roots, have thick leaves and roots, yet no differences in tissue density or photosynthetic water use efficiency when compared to plants of low altitude sites. Both the leaves and roots of the low altitude plants were enriched in N-15 relative to the plants of higher altitude, indicating that the low-N set of traits is associated with a more closed N cycle at high altitude. A second independent set of correlations shows that plants of wetter habitats have lower photosynthetic water use efficiency (more negative partial derivative(13)C) and lower leaf and root tissue density than the plants of drier sites. For both leaves and roots, plants of native species consistently had traits associated with lower resource availability: lower N concentrations, denser tissues, more negative partial derivative(15)N, and more positive partial derivative(13)C than non-native species. If root %N is correlated with root longevity as has been shown in other systems, root longevity may be able to be predicted from simple measurements of leaf %N, though a hysteresis in the relationship between leaf and root N concentrations may make prediction of high longevity roots difficult.","Landcare Res, Dunedin, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Craine, JM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Mail Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand.",jcraine@socrates.berkeley.edu,"Craine, Joseph/D-4569-2009","Craine, Joseph/0000-0001-6561-3244",,,,,39,130,180,8,140,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2003,134,4,,,,,471,478,,10.1007/s00442-002-1155-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-1155-6,,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,655ZD,12647118,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000181582700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Biotic resistance represents an important natural barrier to potential invaders throughout the world, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive such resistance are still debated. In theory, native communities should repel both functionally similar invaders which compete for the same resources, and invaders which possess less competitive traits. However, environmental stress, trade-offs across vital rates and competition-induced plastic trait shifts may modify expected competitive outcomes, thereby influencing invasion dynamics. 2. In order to test these theoretical links between trait distributions and biotic resistance, we performed a mesocosm experiment with 25 non-native ornamental species invading native plant communities. Each non-native species was grown with and without the native community under two watering treatments (regular and reduced). We measured biotic resistance as the difference in performance of non-native individuals grown with and without the community in terms of their survival, growth and reproduction. We quantified overall functional dissimilarity between non-native ornamental individuals and native communities based on the combination of plant height, specific leaf area and seed mass. Then, assuming each of these traits is also potentially linked to competitive ability, we measured the position of non-natives on trait hierarchies. While height is positively correlated with competitive ability for light interception, conservative leaf and seed characteristics provide greater tolerance to competition for other resources. Finally, we quantified plastic trait shifts of non-native individuals induced by competition. 3. Indeed, the native community repelled functionally similar individuals by lowering the invader's survival rate. Simultaneously, shorter ornamental individuals with larger specific leaf areas were less tolerant to biotic resistance from the community across vital rates, although the effect of trait hierarchies often depended on watering conditions. Finally, non-natives responded to competition by shifting their traits. Most importantly, individuals with more competitive traits were able to overcome biotic resistance also through competition-induced plastic trait shifts. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight that both functional dissimilarity and trait hierarchies mediate biotic resistance to ornamental plant invaders. Nevertheless, environmental stress as well as opposing trends across vital rates are also influential. Furthermore, plastic trait shifts can reinforce potential invaders' competitive superiority, determining a positive feedback.","[Conti, Luisa; Acosta, Alicia T.

Unfortunately, tourists and pack animals used to transport equipment can damage sensitive alpine vegetation particularly when they leave trails. This study assessed the impacts of disturbance from off trail use on alpine vegetation in a popular park in the Andes. The effect of different levels of disturbance as well as abiotic factors on alpine steppe vegetation was assessed using generalized linear models and ordinations in 91 plots (20 m(2)) in the popular Horcones Valley that is used to access remote areas in Aconcagua Provincial Park in Argentina. Disturbance off trails resulted in declines in the cover of native plants, including the endemic shrub Adesmia aegiceras but increases in the cover of herbs including the non-native Convolvulus arvensis. Increased disturbance was associated with shifts from stress tolerant species to ruderal plants characterized by more acquisitive traits, including shorter plants with greater Specific Leaf Area. The research demonstrates the severity of impacts from off trail trampling including how trampling favours some species with specific traits over others and why it is important to limit off track use in areas of high conservation value.","[Barros, Agustina; Aschero, Valeria; Mazzolari, Ana] CONICET Mendoza, Inst Argentino Nivol & Glaciol & Ciencias Ambient, Ctr Cient Tecnol CCT, Av Ruiz Leal S-N,CC 330, Mendoza, Argentina; [Aschero, Valeria] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Mendoza, Argentina; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Casilla 160C, Concepcion, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Pickering, Catherine M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Environm Futures Res Inst, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza; Universidad de Concepcion; Griffith University,"Barros, A (corresponding author), CONICET Mendoza, Inst Argentino Nivol & Glaciol & Ciencias Ambient, Ctr Cient Tecnol CCT, Av Ruiz Leal S-N,CC 330, Mendoza, Argentina.",anaagustinabarros@gmail.com; lcaviere@udec.cl,,"Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407",Griffith University in Australia; Scientific and Technological Research Fund (FONCYT) in Argentina [PICT 2015-1455]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development in Chile [FONDECYT 1171005],Griffith University in Australia(Griffith University); Scientific and Technological Research Fund (FONCYT) in Argentina; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development in Chile,"We thank Sebastian Rossi, Martin Cruz Perez Sosa, Ruben Massarelli, Maritza Mihoc and Graciela Valencia for field assistance, the staff in the Direccion de Recursos Naturales Mendoza, IANIGLA, IADIZA.

We experimentally assessed whether communities assembled under colder climates were inherently more open to recruitment than warmer-climate communities, after controlling for differences in the current climate under which the communities were growing. We then tested whether variation in openness to recruitment could be explained by community biomass or by the plant functional traits of the community. The study was conducted in a climate grid of twelve grassland sites across southern Norway, differing systematically in temperature and precipitation. Along a 2000 mm precipitation gradient, we transplanted turfs with intact plant communities from alpine and sub-alpine sites into 2 degrees C warmer sites, and measured natural seedling emergence in these transplanted turfs versus locally replanted control turfs at the transplant destination sites. Mixed effect models were used to assess the effect of origin (cold versus warm climate), biomass, and functional trait composition of the communities on seedling emergence. We further assessed variation in these effects across different climatic contexts (the temperature and precipitation gradients). Communities originating from colder climates were consistently more open to recruitment, with on average 44% more seedlings emerging, than the locally replanted control communities. The higher rates of seedling emergence in colder-climate communities were attributable to systematic differences in plant functional traits, but not in biomass. The colder-climate communities were composed of species with smaller leaves and lower maximum plant heights; traits that may make these communities less effective at excluding new recruits. These trait-related responses were not significant in the warmest sites and did not very across the precipitation gradient. Our results suggest that alpine species lack the competitive effect traits required to make their communities resistant to invasion by novel competitors under climate change.","[Meineri, Eric] Univ Avignon, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,IMBE Marseille, Avignon, France; [Klanderud, Kari] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Guittar, John] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Dept Integrat Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Goldberg, Deborah E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Vandvik, Vigdis] Univ Bergen, Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway",Avignon Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Michigan State University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Bergen,"Meineri, E (corresponding author), Univ Avignon, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD,IMBE Marseille, Avignon, France.",eric.meineri@imbe.fr,"Vandvik, Vigdis/C-1924-2008","Vandvik, Vigdis/0000-0003-4651-4798; , Kari/0000-0003-1049-7025; Meineri, Eric/0000-0001-8825-8986",Norwegian Research Council [184912],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),Norwegian Research Council for funding (KLIMAFORSK project 184912).,,51,11,11,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2020,129,1,,,,,13,23,,10.1111/oik.06243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.06243,,SEP 2019,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JZ7IH,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000488254700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Levels of plant defences and herbivore performance might shift under climate warming, particularly in alpine habitats, where herbivore pressure is currently low. Plant responses to warming should be driven by species-specific shifts in physical and chemical defence traits. We investigated the association between plant leaf physical and chemical traits and herbivory under current and warmer climates in three grasslands along a subalpine to alpine gradient. Specifically, we measured the rate of in situ natural herbivory, and performed bioassays to measure overall plant species-level resistance using the extreme generalist non-native caterpillar Spodoptera littoralis. We simulated warmer conditions by using open-top chambers and assessed the effect of warming on leaf physical and chemical traits, and how trait changes affect caterpillar performance. Natural herbivory and caterpillar performance were associated with plant physical traits, including specific leaf area, and with ordination axes representing dimensions of the plant chemical profile. We found that the warming treatment independently decreased the number of distinct chemical compounds per species, and marginally increased specific leaf area. Changes in leaf functional traits were not systematically associated with changes in caterpillar performance. Synthesis. Plant physical traits and chemical profiles are both related to natural herbivory and plant resistance against Spodoptera littoralis. While leaf physical and chemical traits of high elevation plants were modified by the warming treatment, these changes did not result in predictable effects on plant resistance against herbivores.","[Descombes, Patrice; Pellissier, Loic] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Descombes, Patrice; Pellissier, Loic] Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Kergunteuil, Alan; Rasmann, Sergio] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Lab Funct Ecol, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Glauser, Gaetan G.] Univ Neuchatel, Neuchatel Platform Analyt Chem, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Neuchatel; University of Neuchatel","Descombes, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Descombes, P (corresponding author), Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",patrice.descombes@wsl.ch,"Pellissier, Loïc/AAG-1013-2020; Rasmann, Sergio/T-5376-2017","Pellissier, Loïc/0000-0002-2289-8259; Rasmann, Sergio/0000-0002-3120-6226; Descombes, Patrice/0000-0002-3760-9907","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [162604, 179481]",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 162604 and 179481",,112,18,19,11,125,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We assess the presence of introduced plant species and their persistence (since the previous survey) in a Canadian subpolar site on the Hudson Bay with a history of human introductions from large-scale grain inputs. Widespread sampling was done to locate all introduced plant species in the Churchill, MB, Canada area. We quantified edaphic variations through soil sampling, and the effect of aspect on introduced species' richness, cover, and height. At the regional scale, species life history traits and climate envelopes (average and variability of climate in a native range) were established to determine if persistent plant species had similar climate requirements. We found that despite statistically significant warming and increased precipitation, the number of introduced plant species in sub-Arctic Churchill declined from 80 to 36 between the 1989 and 2013 sampling periods. We found that introduced species favor locally warmer, human-disturbed sites with above average soil nutrients. The plant species that remained in Churchill since the 1989 survey compared to those that did not persist are better able to tolerate colder temperatures and have wider, more variable climate envelopes. The decline in introduced species is likely linked to changes in grain shipment inputs. Many of the introduced species recorded in 1989 may have only existed through constant seed subsidies from imports, suggesting that most species have not yet been successful in the absence of human modification. Although the number of introduced plants has decreased, we suggest that continuous disturbance is no longer required for some introduced species to persist suggesting that a climate threshold may have been crossed for some species. One introduced species (Taraxacum officinale, common dandelion) has spread to areas that have not been modified by humans and is now growing in two undisturbed locations. Its current distribution outside disturbed areas does not yet warrant the distinction of invasive at this time. The findings of this study suggest that in the Canadian Arctic, if disturbance and nutrient enrichment are reduced, the potential for introduced plants to establish and possibly become invasive is still limited but will likely change as warming continues.","[Kent, Alex; Drezner, Taly Dawn; Bello, Richard] York Univ, Dept Geog, N430 Ross,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Drezner, TD (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Geog, N430 Ross,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",drezner@yorku.ca,,,Northern Scientific Training Program; Faculty of Graduate Studies at York University,Northern Scientific Training Program; Faculty of Graduate Studies at York University,This study was funded by the Northern Scientific Training Program and the Faculty of Graduate Studies at York University.,,61,11,11,3,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4060,1432-2056,,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,OCT,2018,41,10,,,,,2007,2022,,10.1007/s00300-018-2341-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-018-2341-2,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GU3WX,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000445212100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the 'current' emerging invasive alien plant species of the DAC are of a northern-temperate affinity and belong to the families Fabaceae and Rosaceae (four taxa each), followed by Boraginaceae and Onagraceae (two taxa each). In terms of functional type (growth form), most taxa are shrubs (9), followed by herbs (8), tall trees (5), and a single climber. The need to undertake a fieldwork component is highlighted and a list of potential study sites to sample disturbed habitats is provided. A global change driver such as increased temperature is predicted to not only result in extirpation of native alpine species, but to also possibly render the environment more susceptible to alien plant invasions due to enhanced competitive ability and pre-adapted traits. A list of emerging invasive alien plants is essential to bring about swift management interventions to reduce the threat of such biological invasions.","Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Sci Serv, ZA-3202 Cascades, South Africa",,"Carbutt, C (corresponding author), Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Sci Serv, POB 13053, ZA-3202 Cascades, South Africa.",carbuttc@kznwildlife.com,,,,,,,86,21,21,0,36,SOUTH AFRICAN NATL BIODIVERSITY INST-SANBI,PRETORIA,"PRIVATE BAG X101,  SILVERTON 0184, 2 CUSSONIA AVE, PRETORIA, BRUMMERIA, SOUTH AFRICA",0006-8241,2311-9284,,BOTHALIA,Bothalia,OCT,2012,42,2,,,,,71,85,,10.4102/abc.v42i2.10,http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/abc.v42i2.10,,,15,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,044XH,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000311658000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Work in salt marshes on the Atlantic Coast of the United States has documented community-wide latitudinal gradients in plant palatability and plant traits that may be driven in part by greater herbivore pressure at low latitudes. To determine if similar patterns exist elsewhere, we studied six taxa of saltmarsh plants (Atriplex, Juncus, Limonium, Salicornia, Spartina and Suaeda) at European sites at high (Germany and the Netherlands) and low (Portugal and Spain) latitudes. We conducted feeding assays using both native and non-native consumers, and documented patterns of herbivore damage in the field. As in the United States, high-latitude plants tended to be more palatable than low-latitude plants when offered to consumers in paired feeding assays in the laboratory, although assays with grasshopper consumers were less consistent than those with crab consumers, and plants in the field at low-latitude sites tended to experience greater levels of herbivore pressure than plants at high-latitude sites. Similarly, high-latitude leaf litter was more palatable than litter from low-latitude plants when offered to consumers in paired feeding assays in the laboratory. Latitudinal gradients in plant palatability and herbivore pressure may be a general phenomenon, and may contribute to latitudinal gradients in decomposition processes.","Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, DE-24098 Kiel, Germany; Univ Algarve, Fac Ciencias Mar & Ambiente, PT-8005139 Faro, Portugal; Univ Georgia, Dept Marine Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; ENSR Int, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Kiel; Universidade do Algarve; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Pennings, SC (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",spennings@uh.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125; Zimmer, Martin/0000-0002-1549-8871; HO, CHUAN-KAI/0000-0002-6437-0073",,,,,31,47,49,1,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2007,116,4,,,,,543,549,,10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15591.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15591.x,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,151TK,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000245313500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a notable limitation is that studies usually rely on a small and easy-to-measure set of functional traits, which might not immediately reflect ongoing ecological responses to changing abiotic or biotic conditions, including those that occur at a molecular or physiological level. We explored the potential of using the diversity of expressed genes-functional genomic diversity (FGD)-to understand ecological dynamics of a recent and ongoing alpine invasion. We quantified FGD based on transcriptomic data measured for 26 plant species occurring along adjacent invaded and pristine streambeds. We used an RNA-seq approach to summarize the overall number of expressed transcripts and their annotations to functional categories, and contrasted this with functional trait diversity (FTD) measured from a suite of characters that have been traditionally considered in plant ecology. We found greater FGD and FTD in the invaded community, independent of differences in species richness. However, the magnitude of functional dispersion was greater from the perspective of FGD than from FTD. Comparing FGD between congeneric alien-native species pairs, we did not find many significant differences in the proportion of genes whose annotations matched functional categories. Still, native species with a greater relative abundance in the invaded community compared with the pristine tended to express a greater fraction of genes at significant levels in the invaded community, suggesting that changes in FGD may relate to shifts in community composition. Comparisons of diversity patterns from the community to the species level offer complementary insights into processes and mechanisms driving invasion dynamics. FGD has the potential to illuminate cryptic changes in ecological diversity, and we foresee promising avenues for future extensions across taxonomic levels and macro-ecosystems.","[Marx, Hannah E.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Marx, Hannah E.] Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Carboni, Marta] Univ Roma TRE, Dept Sci, Rome, Italy; [Douzet, Rolland; Perrier, Christophe; Delbart, Franck] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Jardin Lautaret, Lautaret, CNRS, Grenoble, France; [Thuiller, Wilfried; Lavergne, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Inst Bioinformat & Evolutionary Studies, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Idaho, Stillinger Herbarium, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82072 USA; [Tank, David C.] Univ Wyoming, Rocky Mt Herbarium, Laramie, WY 82072 USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico; Italfarmaco; Roma Tre University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; Idaho; University of Idaho; University of Wyoming; University of Wyoming,"Marx, HE (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.;Marx, HE (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",hmarx@unm.edu,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Marx, Hannah/0000-0002-3526-7878; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758",NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program; NSF Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW); Chateaubriand Fellowship initiated research abroad in France; Lautaret Garden [UMS 3370]; Labex OSUG@2020 [ANR10 LABX56]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [P30 GM103324]; University of Idaho; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 [281422];  [ANR-11-INBS-0001],NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Chateaubriand Fellowship initiated research abroad in France; Lautaret Garden; Labex OSUG@2020; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); University of Idaho; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013; ,"Funding from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program supported H.E.M., and an NSF Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) and Chateaubriand Fellowship initiated research abroad in France.

Addressing the requirement for more information about the ecological impacts of recreational activities, seed dispersal from mountain biking and hiking were compared under different climatic and environmental conditions. Seeds from a range of graminids and forbs were found to attach to the mountain bike, rider and hiker, including environmental weed seeds, on trails and in-field in montane Australia. While the composition of seeds differed between the two activities, no significant differences were found between traits, such as natives or environmental weed, graminids or forbs, perennial or annual, large or small, attachment or no attachment structures, although sample sizes were small. Few seeds attached to the mountain bike, rider or hiker on dry trails, some seeds attached when trails were wet, but more seeds attached when riding/hiking off trail in a field. Cleaning clothing and bikes and avoiding areas with environmental weed seeding could reduce the risk of this type of unintentional human mediated dispersal, but compliance with such measures may be challenging. Given the increasing popularity of mountain biking and the current controversy about the relative impacts of mountain biking in areas of high conservation concern, additional research assessing severity, duration and range of impacts of mountain biking on soil, wildlife, waterways and vegetation is critical.","[Pickering, Catherine] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University,"Pickering, C (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4222, Australia.",c.pickering@griffith.edu.au,,"Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407",,,,,76,1,1,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

We imported seeds of lowland species to tundra under factorial treatments of warming, fertilization, herbivore exclusion and biomass removal. We show that warming alone had little impact on lowland species, while exclusion of native herbivores and relaxation of nutrient limitation greatly benefitted them. In contrast, warming alone benefitted resident tundra species and increased species richness; however, these were canceled by negative effects of herbivore exclusion and fertilization. Dominance of lowland species was associated with low cover of tundra species and resulted in decreased species richness. Our results highlight the critical role of biotic and abiotic filters unrelated to temperature in protecting tundra under warmer climate. While scarcity of soil nutrients and native herbivores act as important agents of resistance to invasions by lowland species, they concurrently promote overall species coexistence. However, when these biotic and abiotic resistances are relaxed, invasion of lowland species can lead to decreased abundance of resident tundra species and diminished diversity.","[Eskelinen, Anu] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Eskelinen, Anu] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Research UFZ, Dept Physiol Div, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Eskelinen, Anu] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kaarlejarvi, El Ina; Olofsson, Johan] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Kaarlejarvi, El Ina] Vrije Univ Brussel, Plant Biol & Nat Management, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",University of Oulu; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Umea University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Eskelinen, A (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, POB 3000, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.;Eskelinen, A (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Environm Research UFZ, Dept Physiol Div, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;Eskelinen, A (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",anu.eskelinen@idiv.de,"Olofsson, Johan/A-9362-2009",,"Finnish Cultural Foundation; Academy of Finland [253385]; Nordic Centre of Excellence - Tundra; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning [2006-1539]; Swedish Research Council [2015-00498]","Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Nordic Centre of Excellence - Tundra; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council)","We thank Susan Harrison, Anne Marie Panetta, Lauren Sullivan and Risto Virtanen for helpful comments on the earlier version of the manuscript.

Both provenances need to acclimate to climate warming, yet we lack comprehensive understanding of how their growth, photosynthesis and leaf traits differ. Further, the provenances presumably have morphological and physiological adaptations to their native environments and therefore differ in response to photoperiod. We tested the height growth, leaf longevity, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation and rates of gas exchange of northern (67 degrees N) and southern (61 degrees N) Finnish silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) origins in CL- and NCL-treatments in a 4-month chamber experiment. Irrespective of photoperiod, 67 degrees N had higher area-based photosynthetic rate (A(net)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and relative height growth rate (RGR), but lower stomatal density and fewer branches and leaves than 61 degrees N. Photoperiod affected height growth cessation, biomass and photosynthetic traits, whereas leaf longevity and many leaf functional traits remained unchanged. In CL, both provenances had lower g(s), higher RGR, increased shoot:root ratio and increased sink sizes (more branching, more leaves, increased total plant dry weight) compared with NCL. In NCL, 67 degrees N ceased height growth earlier than in CL, which altered biomass accumulation and distribution patterns. Northern conditions impose challenges for plant growth and physiology. Whether a provenance inhabits and is adapted to an area with or without CL can also affect its response to the changing climate. Northern birches may have adapted to CL and the short growing season with a 'polar day syndrome' of traits, including relatively high gas exchange rates with low leaf biomass and growth traits that are mainly limited by the environment and the earlier growth cessation (to avoid frost damage).","[Tenkanen, Antti; Keinanen, Markku; Oksanen, Elina; Keski-Saari, Sarita; Kontunen-Soppela, Sari] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Yliopistokatu 7,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Keinanen, Markku] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Photon, Yliopistokatu 7,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland",University of Eastern Finland; University of Eastern Finland,"Tenkanen, A (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm & Biol Sci, Yliopistokatu 7,POB 111, Joensuu 80101, Finland.",tenkanen@uef.fi,"Keski-Saari, Sarita/AFV-2491-2022; Keinänen, Markku/HNS-7959-2023","Keski-Saari, Sarita/0000-0003-1967-7428; Tenkanen, Antti/0000-0003-2389-2876; Keinanen, Markku/0000-0003-0458-5520; Kontunen-Soppela, Sari/0000-0003-3952-594X","Finnish Cultural Foundation's North Karelia regional fund [55151977, 55161315, 55172225]; Finnish Society of Forest Science [201810043]; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; University of Eastern Finland Doctoral School funding; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN) [320166]",Finnish Cultural Foundation's North Karelia regional fund; Finnish Society of Forest Science; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; University of Eastern Finland Doctoral School funding; Academy of Finland Flagship Programme Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN),"Finnish Cultural Foundation's North Karelia regional fund (55151977, 55161315, 55172225 to AI); The Finnish Society of Forest Science (201810043 to AT.); The Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation (to A.I.); University of Eastern Finland Doctoral School funding (to A.T.); The work is part of Academy of Finland Flagship Programme Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN), decision 320166.",,60,1,1,3,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/treephys/tpac104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpac104,,SEP 2022,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,5G9RC,36049078,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2023-03-22,WOS:000867326100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments on plants have focused largely on novel competitive interactions; other species interactions, such as plant-microbe symbioses, while less studied, may also influence plant responses to climate change. In this greenhouse study, we evaluated interactions between soil microbes and alpine-restricted plant species, simulating a warming scenario in which low-elevation microbes migrate upslope into the distribution of alpine plants. We examined three alpine grasses from the Rocky Mountains, CO, USA (Poa alpina, Festuca brachyphylla, and Elymus scribneri). We used soil inocula from within (resident) or below (novel) the plants' current elevation range and examined responses in plant biomass, plant traits, and fungal colonization of roots. Resident soil inocula from the species' home range decreased biomass to a greater extent than novel soil inocula. The depressed growth in resident soils suggested that these soils harbor more carbon-demanding microbes, as plant biomass generally declined with greater fungal colonization of roots, especially in resident soil inocula. Although plant traits did not respond to the provenance of soil inocula, specific leaf area declined and root:shoot ratio increased when soil inocula were sterilized, indicating microbial mediation of plant trait expression. Contrary to current predictions, our findings suggest that if upwardly migrating microbes were to displace current soil microbes, alpine plants may benefit from this warming-induced microbial re-shuffling.","[Lynn, Joshua S.; Duarte, Danielle A.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Lynn, Joshua S.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO 81224 USA; [Lynn, Joshua S.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, N-5006 Bergen, Norway",University of New Mexico; University of Bergen,"Lynn, JS (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.;Lynn, JS (corresponding author), Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO 81224 USA.;Lynn, JS (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, N-5006 Bergen, Norway.",Joshua.Lynn@uib.no,,"Lynn, Joshua/0000-0002-7190-7991",University of New Mexico Biology Department Grove Summer Scholarship; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Fund; United States National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology [1354972],University of New Mexico Biology Department Grove Summer Scholarship; American Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Fund; United States National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology,"We thank the Rudgers-Whitney lab for comments on early analyses for the project and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Sonneratia apetala, a species used in afforestation projects in southern China, was introduced from Bangladesh in 1985. This species has the capacity to colonize in mangrove mudflats and invade natural mangrove community of China. However, its effectiveness to do so may change with latitude. Aiming to provide reproduction evidence on S. apetala invasiveness from the perspective of fruit and seed properties, we conducted in situ observations of fruit and seed properties of 12 S. apetala populations across the latitudinal gradient from Haikou (19.60 degrees N) to Quangang (25.25 degrees N, current latitudinal limit for this species). Fruits per tree decreased with increasing latitude (R-2 = 0.47; p < 0.0001); fruit weight (R-2 = 0.28; p < 0.0001) and volume (R-2 = 0.27; p < 0.0001) varied quadratically relative to latitude. However, seed quantity per fruit, weight and volume were not correlated with latitude. The relationship between fruit and several climatic factors showed that mean annual precipitation, mean annual low temperature and mean annual irradiance had significant effects on these properties. Fruit floating percentages suggested decreases with time but was markedly site specific. Accordingly, the dispersing potentials were high in low latitude regions with small and light fruits but with big quantity; while they were weak in high-latitude regions where medium size fruits might resist the cold in winter. The mid-latitude sites with large fruits and great germination percentage resulted in good performance and establishment, where the species invasiveness should be noted.","[Hong, Pubin; Wen, Yuye; Xiong, Yiyi; Diao, Lifu; Gu, Xiaoxuan; Feng, Hongyu; Yang, Chen; Chen, Luzhen] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Chen, LZ (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Key Lab, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.",luzhenchen@xmu.edu.cn,"Hong, Pubin/AFD-7648-2022","FENG, Hongyu/0000-0001-9658-3498","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0506103]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770579, 41476071]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are thankful to Xinli Wang, Chenjuan Zheng, Canmou Wang, and Xiaofang Shi for their assistance in the field survey, and Dr. D.

In turn, bacteria have the potential for altering the plant phenotype. Field experiments can help to estimate bacterial effects on plant functional traits under natural conditions. We used a transplantation approach of culturable bacterial communities to explore how manipulation of leaf-associated microbial communities in two different successional stages within a glacier foreland can influence microbial composition and functional plant traits. Our study documents successional stage-specific variations in the composition of foliar bacterial communities and shifts therein throughout a season and between years. We show that cultured bacteria transferred between plant communities can alter diversity and composition of the microbiome on plant community level as well as species-specific functional plant traits of two selected plant species within one growing season. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a strong resilience of plant-associated bacterial communities and of plants in response to bacterial invaders. Our study illustrates that inoculation experiments in the field with naturally occurring microbial communities of wild plants are suited to investigate complex interactions between microbial communities, the environment, and plant traits.","[Ohler, Lisa-Maria; Junker, Robert R.] Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Plants, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Ohler, Lisa-Maria; Otto, Jan-Christoph] Univ Salzburg, Dept Geog & Geol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Seeleitner, Sarah; Junker, Robert R.] Univ Salzburg, Dept Biosci, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Haselberger, Stefan; Kraushaar, Sabine] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Mitter, Birgit] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Ctr Hlth & Bioresources, Bioresources Unit, A-3430 Tulln, Austria",Philipps University Marburg; Salzburg University; Salzburg University; University of Vienna; Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT),"Junker, RR (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Plants, D-35043 Marburg, Germany.;Junker, RR (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Biosci, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",robert.junker@uni-marburg.de,"Otto, Jan-Christoph/C-3624-2008","Otto, Jan-Christoph/0000-0002-4552-3011; Kraushaar, Sabine/0000-0001-8849-8162; Junker, Robert R./0000-0002-7919-9678; Ohler, Lisa-Maria/0000-0002-0213-6927",Projekt DEAL; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [776681],Projekt DEAL; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Although a growing number of studies suggest that the dispersal propensity of invasive plants increases during range expansion, there has been relatively little attention paid to dispersal patterns along elevational gradients. In this study, we tested the differentiation of dispersal-related traits in an invasive plant, Galinsoga quadriradiata, across populations at different elevations in the Qinling and Bashan Mountains in central China. Seed mass-area ratio (MAR), an important seed dispersal-related trait, of 45 populations from along an elevational gradient was measured, and genetic variation of 23 populations was quantified using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Individuals from four populations were then planted in a greenhouse to compare their performance under shared conditions. Changing patterns of seed dispersal-related traits and populations genetic diversity along elevation were tested using linear regression. Mass-area ratio of G. quadriradiata increased, while genetic diversity decreased with elevation in the field survey. In the greenhouse, populations of G. quadriradiata sourced from different elevations showed a difference response of MAR. These results suggest that although rapid evolution may contribute to the range expansion of G. quadriradiata in mountain ranges, dispersal-related traits will also likely be affected by phenotypic plasticity. This challenges the common argument that dispersal ability of invasive plants increases along dispersal routes. Furthermore, our results suggest that high-altitude populations would be more effective at seed dispersal once they continue to expand their range downslope on the other side. Our experiment provides novel evidence that the spread of these high-altitude populations may be more likely than previously theorized and that they should thus be cautiously monitored.","[Liu, Rui-Ling; Yang, Ying-Bo; Liu, Gang; Zhang, Wen-Gang; Chen, Xiao-Yan; Song, Xing-Jiang; Kang, Ju-Qing; Zhu, Zhi-Hong] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Lee, Benjamin R.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Liu, Gang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Resource Dev Endangered Crude Drugs, Xian 710119, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Shaanxi Normal University,"Liu, G (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710119, Peoples R China.;Liu, G (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Resource Dev Endangered Crude Drugs, Xian 710119, Peoples R China.",2003liugang@163.com,"chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; Lee, Benjamin/AAV-5396-2021; Lee, Benjamin/HLX-7911-2023; Chen, Xiao/GQA-8928-2022; Yang, Yingbo/HOF-6033-2023; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022","Lee, Benjamin/0000-0002-5256-0515; Lee, Benjamin/0000-0002-5256-0515; Chen, Xiao/0000-0002-9797-8384; Yang, Yingbo/0000-0001-6707-7983; Song, Xing-Jiang/0000-0001-5605-4444; Liu, Gang/0000-0002-5633-4216","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600445, 31570425, 11671243]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2020JM-286]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK202103072, 2019CSLY019, 2020CSLY014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600445, 31570425 and 11671243), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2020JM-286), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (GK202103072, 2019CSLY019 and 2020CSLY014).",,0,2,2,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,,,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,JUN 16,2021,13,3,,,,,,,,10.1093/aobpla/plab008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plab008,,JUN 2021,11,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UV8TL,34194688,gold,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000699743400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although complete eradication of invasive exotics is a common restoration goal, an emerging approach in heavily invaded landscapes is to plant native species likely to persist, even in the presence of exotic competition. Functional traits may be used to inform restoration strategies by indicating whether native and exotic species are likely to occupy different niches (i.e., dissimilar traits indicate different resource strategies). We adopted a functional trait approach to test whether planting species with dissimilar, as opposed to similar, traits to exotic species enhanced native species cover and diversity for an urban restoration project that is heavily invaded by Hedera helix (English ivy) and Hedera canariensis (canary ivy). We conducted a trait screening of Hedera and 37 candidate native understory plants and used trait values to select three species that were functionally dissimilar and three that were functionally similar to Hedera. We then tested their survival and growth when planted in and out of competition with Hedera over two years. Species with dissimilar traits to Hedera had high survival and growth across time and competitive environments, whereas species with similar traits to Hedera had significantly reduced survival when in competition with Hedera. Our results suggest that, in heavily invaded landscapes, restoration projects that plant species with complementary resource strategies to exotics may be most successful and that functional traits are a useful tool to select these species.","[Hallett, Lauren M.; Chapple, Dylan E.; Bickart, Nathan; Cherbowsky, Ariel; Fernandez, Lawrence; Ho, Cheuk H.; Alexander, Martin; Schwab, Ken; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 137 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hallett, Lauren M.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Hallett, Lauren M.] Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, 5223 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Hallett, Lauren M.] Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, 5223 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Oregon; University of Oregon,"Hallett, LM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 137 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Hallett, LM (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA.;Hallett, LM (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Environm Studies Program, 5223 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.;Hallett, LM (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Biol, 5223 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",lauren.m.hallett@gmail.com,"HALLETT, LAUREN/R-1560-2017","HALLETT, LAUREN/0000-0002-0718-0257",UC Berkeley's The Green Fund Initiative; Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Sustainability; UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship,UC Berkeley's The Green Fund Initiative; Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Sustainability; UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship,"We thank Brad Butterfield, Tim Pine, Jim Horner, Phil Stevens, and Kristen Van Dam for their input on project design, Jesse Fried for his help with the trait screening, the Strawberry Creek Restoration Program volunteers with their help with the trait screening, ivy removal and out-planting, and Marko Spasojevic for his comments.

It is a challenge to project suitable habitat distributions of invasive plant species (IPS) for invasion risk assessment at large spatial scales. Interaction outcomes between native and invasive plant species are dependent as a function of trait context, which may contribute to suitable habitat distributions of IPS. Here, we explored the effect of functional trait context on suitable habitat distribution of invasive plant species at a global scale. The plant functional trait context was quantified based on the community mean values of specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentration, height, and woody density. Habitat suitability modeling was used to project suitable habitat distributions of IPS based on functional trait and abiotic (climate, soil, and human footprint) contexts. There were significant differences in contexts between functional traits and abiotic conditions for IPS across different biomes at a global scale. Community mean functional traits, particularly, height could contribute to habitat suitability of IPS. The functional trait context could have a large effect on the habitat suitability of IPS in Boreal forests/Taiga, Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands, Tundra, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub, and Mangroves. Functional trait context could affect suitable habitat distributions of IPS at a global scale, indicating that functional trait context should be used as the input for modeling habitat suitability of IPS.

By analysing 131,394 occurrence records of 1,334 plant species collected over 20 years in the European Alps, we found that non-natives are spreading upwards approximately twice as fast as natives. Whereas the spread of natives was enhanced by traits favouring longer dispersal distances, this was not the case for non-natives. This was due to the non-native species pool already being strongly biased towards species that had traits facilitating spread. A large proportion of native and non-native species seemed to be able to spread upwards faster than the current velocity of climate change. In particular, long-distance dispersal events and proximity to roads proved to be key drivers for the observed rapid spread. Our findings highlight that invasionsby non-native species intonative alpine communities are a potentially significant additional pressure on these vulnerable ecosystems that are already likely to suffer dramatic vegetation changes with ongoing warming and increasing human activity in mountain regions.","[Dainese, Matteo; Marini, Lorenzo] Univ Padua, DAFNAE, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy; [Dainese, Matteo] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Aikio, Sami] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, POB 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hulme, Philip E.] Lincoln Univ, Bioprotect Res Ctr, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Bertolli, Alessio; Prosser, Filippo] Museo Civ Rovereto, Borgo Santa Caterina 41, I-38068 Rovereto, Trento, Italy",University of Padua; University of Wurzburg; University of Helsinki; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Dainese, M; Marini, L (corresponding author), Univ Padua, DAFNAE, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.;Dainese, M (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",matteo.dainese@uni-wuerzburg.de; lorenzo.marini@unipd.it,"Hulme, Philip/F-7454-2011; Marini, Lorenzo/B-1119-2009; Dainese, Matteo/M-1472-2017","Hulme, Philip/0000-0001-5712-0474; Marini, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7429-7685; Dainese, Matteo/0000-0001-7052-5572",Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) within ACE-SAP project; Kone Foundation,Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) within ACE-SAP project; Kone Foundation,"The work of L.M., A.B. and F.P. were partly funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) within the ACE-SAP project (University and Scientific Research Service regulation number 23, June 12, 2008).

Moreover, current knowledge is heavily biased to the temperate regions of the world and we know much less about traits and impacts of invaders in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. We studied two leaf traits of the invasive alien shrub Chromolaena odorata and the impacts of its invasion on native vegetation in savannas. We compared specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI) between C. odorata and native species and assessed how C. odorata differentially affects canopy light interception, soil moisture, soil nutrients, and litter accumulation compared to native species. We found that C. odorata has higher SLA and LAI than native species, lower light and moisture levels below its canopy, but higher nutrient levels and a higher litter accumulation rate. Because of its higher SLA, C. odorata grows faster, resulting in more biomass, increased litter accumulation and higher nutrient availability. Due to its high SLA and LAI, C. odorata intercepts more light and reduces available moisture more than do native trees due to higher transpiration rates, reducing the biomass of native understory vegetation. This study provides empirical evidence for strong links between plant functional traits and ecological impact of invasive plant species, highlighting the importance of traits in predicting ecosystem-level impacts of invasive plant species.","[te Beest, Mariska] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [te Beest, Mariska; Esler, Karen J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [te Beest, Mariska; Esler, Karen J.; Richardson, David M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Richardson, David M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Umea University; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"te Beest, M (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",mariskatebeest@hotmail.com,"Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; te Beest, Mariska/0000-0003-3673-4105",Dutch Scientific Organization (NWO-Pionier); Stellenbosch University (Sub Committee); Nordic Centre of Excellence TUNDRA - Norden Top-Level Research Initiative Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change''; National Research Foundation [85417],Dutch Scientific Organization (NWO-Pionier); Stellenbosch University (Sub Committee); Nordic Centre of Excellence TUNDRA - Norden Top-Level Research Initiative Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change''; National Research Foundation,"We thank the Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife research and management staff of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park for providing support for the study, H.

We reviewed 18 surve of 401 sites conducted between 1986 and 2004 and examined the distribution and characteristics of common weeds on roadsides in the Snowy Mountains, Australia, to determine the range of natural habitats these weeds are found in, whether they are limited to disturbed sites, whether they are also common in other mountain regions including the Australian Alps, and whether they have invasive traits. There are only 8 common weeds in the Snowy Mountains: Acetosella vulgaris (also known as Rumex acetosella), Hypochaeris radicata, Trifolium repens, Taraxacum officinale, Agrostis capillaris, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and Achillea millefolium . They occur in areas disturbed by humans, such as along roadsides and around buildings and tracks, from the low-altitude montane zone to the high-altitude high subalpine/alpine zone. They also occur to varying extents in undisturbed native vegetation, reflecting their invasive capacity. These species are all perennial, with high vegetative and/or sexual reproduction, native to Europe, and are found growing on roadsides and in native vegetation in mountains in Europe, North America, South America, and New Zealand. Therefore, it appears that these plants are the usual suspects: common mountain weeds, which may be found worldwide at high altitude.","[Pickering, Catherine; Hill, Wendy] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 9726, Australia",Griffith University,"Pickering, C (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, PMB 50,Gold Coast Mail Ctr, Gold Coast, Qld 9726, Australia.",c.pickering@griffith.edu.au; wendy.hill@griffith.edu.au,,"Pickering, Catherine/0000-0002-3731-5407",,,,,46,35,38,3,46,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT,LAWRENCE,"BUSINESS OFFICE, 810 E 10TH ST, PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KANSAS 66044-8897 USA",0276-4741,1994-7151,,MT RES DEV,Mt.

Despite this recognition, interactions between traits and community filters are generally neglected. Here, we aim to address this limitation by developing a hierarchical framework that builds on trait-based theory to model occurrences of alien species as a function of spatially explicit variables, filtering invasions and their interactions with species traits. Location Time period Herbaceous communities throughout France. c. 1960-2012 (mostly after 1990). Major taxa studied Methods Herbaceous plants. Based on a large dataset of >50,000 community plots, we built a multispecies hierarchical model of the distribution of the 10 most widespread alien plants in French grasslands. In this model, we explicitly account for how plant height, specific leaf area (SLA) and seed mass affect the occurrence of alien species along gradients of human pressure, environmental conditions and native community composition. Finally, we contrast the results to native species responses along the same gradients. Results Main conclusions We show that two out of three traits significantly modulate the responses of species along these broad gradients. Alien plants with exploitative traits (i.e., tall and with high SLA) were less dependent on human pressure, more efficient in resource-rich environments and better at avoiding competition from native species. These trait-gradient interactions were often unique to alien plants (e.g., human pressure was important only for supporting alien species with low SLA), even though trait ranges of alien and native species were comparable. Ultimately, the modelling of trait-gradient interactions allows spatially explicit estimations of invasion risks by novel species with particular sets of traits. By taking the best from multispecies distribution modelling and trait-based theory, our framework paves the way for a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence the success of alien plants and their spatial distributions.","[Carboni, Marta; Calderon-Sanou, Irene; Pollock, Laura; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Carboni, Marta] Univ Toronto, Biol Sci, Scarborough, ON, Canada; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, EPHE, Univ Montpellier, CEFE,CNRS,UMR 5175, Montpellier, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Carboni, M (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",marta.carboni@gmx.net,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758; Calderon-Sanou, Irene/0000-0003-4608-1187","European Community's Seventh Framework Program [FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF, IASIMOV 327616]; ANR [ANR-13-EBID-0004]",European Community's Seventh Framework Program(European Commission); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"European Community's Seventh Framework Program, Grant/Award Number: FP7-PEOPLE-2012-IEF and IASIMOV 327616; ANR, Grant/Award Number: ANR-13-EBID-0004",,63,20,20,7,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Here we highlight four reasons that are preventing the use of traits in restoration, ranging from different restoration targets and frameworks to practical considerations around species selection, databases, plant stock availability, and measurement approaches. We provide actions that can be taken by researchers, practitioners, plant stock producers, and policy makers to better incorporate functional traits in restoration practice and show how traits can complement existing practices to achieve both traditional/taxonomic and functional restoration targets.

Structure, floristic composition and invasibility of the plant communities and attributes of the invasive species were studied. To determine the plant characteristics correlated with invasiveness, we distinguished between roadside invaders, native community invaders and non-invasive exotic species, and compared these groups across a range of traits including functional group, taxonomic affinity, life history, mating system and morphology. Poa grasslands and Eucalyptus-Poa woodlands contained the largest number of exotic species, although all communities studied appeared resilient to invasion by most species. Most community invaders were broad-leaved herbs while roadside invaders contained both herbs and a range of grass species. Over the entire study area the richness and cover of native and exotic herbaceous species were positively related, but exotic herbs were more negatively related to cover of specific functional groups (e.g. trees) than native herbs. Compared with the overall pool of exotic species, those capable of invading native plant communities were disproportionately polycarpic, Asteracean and cross-pollinating. Our data support the hypothesis that strong ecological filtering of exotic species generates an exotic assemblage containing few dominant species and which functionally converges on the native assemblage. These findings contrast with those observed in the majority of invaded natural systems. We conclude that the invasion of closed sub-alpine communities must be viewed in terms of the unique attributes of the invading species, the structure and composition of the invaded communities and the strong extrinsic physical and climatic factors typical of the sub-alpine environment.","CSIRO Plant Ind, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Australian Natl Herbarium, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Godfree, R (corresponding author), CSIRO Plant Ind, GPO Box 1600, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",robert.godfree@csiro.au; brendan.lepschi@csiro.au; david.mallinson@deh.gov.au,"Godfree, Robert C/J-8363-2012; Lepschi, Brendan J/I-5376-2012",,,,,,49,46,50,0,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, few studies have investigated the trait covariance in the native and invasive ranges. Such investigation will give a more comprehensive picture of how historical contingency and adaptation shape invasiveness, contributing to the prediction of future invasion dynamics. Here, we collected seven and nine populations alongside latitudes from invasive and native ranges of a global invasive plant, Spartina alterniflora, and planted them in two common gardens at the southernmost and northernmost sites of the invasive range. We measured plant traits, including the first flowering time, plant height and seed set, and analysed how these traits varied with garden sites and populations' origin latitudes and how their covariance changed between ranges. We found that plants flowered later, grew taller and set more seeds in the high-latitude garden than the low-latitude one. The growth and expression of genetic variation of traits appeared to be limited by high ambient temperature in the low-latitude garden. In the high-latitude garden, the flowering time of populations showed clinal variation for both invasive and native populations, whereas the plant height and seed set showed clinal variation only for native or invasive populations. From the native to the invasive range, the flowering time and seed set developed negative genetic covariance, and flowering time and plant height changed from negative genetically correlated to uncorrelated. Our results suggested that S. alterniflora has experienced rapid adaptation to clinal and local conditions over the 40-year invasion. Such geographic-scale rapid adaptation appeared to have benefited from previously identified genetic admixture that has released the trait covariance. Our study highlights the importance of integrating full-range geographical surveys with introduction history to understand the potential and mechanisms of trait evolution during invasion.

To our knowledge, no comparative analysis between native and alien species has been carried out in the same mountain habitats. We characterized the main habitats of the Italian Alps on the basis of plant species traits and we then tested for evidence of functional axes of variation among the habitats for native and alien plants. Finally, we tested the 'try-harder' and the 'join-the-locals' hypotheses to understand whether coexisting native and alien plant species showed converging or diverging functional attributes. Ordination analysis showed a distribution of the habitats according to the Grime's CSR strategies, and associated to plant growth form and resource acquisition. Co-inertia analysis showed a significant association between native and alien plant traits at habitat level (RV = 0.73; Monte-Carlo test, p = 0.035). Across all species and habitats, the comparative analysis of individual traits showed that alien species have 25% higher plant height, 250% higher leaf mass, 19% lower leaf dry matter content, 10% higher SLA, and 17% longer flowering duration than native species. Overall, our findings demonstrated that aliens differ in many traits from native species in the Italian Alps, but that many of these differences disappear when one compares aliens and natives that co-occur in the same types of habitats.","[Dainese, Matteo] Univ Padua, Dept Land & Agroforest Environm, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Bragazza, Luca] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bragazza, Luca] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bragazza, Luca] Univ Ferrara, Dept Biol & Evolut, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy","University of Padua; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Ferrara","Dainese, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Land & Agroforest Environm, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",matteo.dainese@unipd.it,"Bragazza, Luca/U-9089-2017; Dainese, Matteo/M-1472-2017","Bragazza, Luca/0000-0001-8583-284X; Dainese, Matteo/0000-0001-7052-5572",,,,,62,31,31,5,54,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1664-2201,1664-221X,,ALPINE BOT,Alp.

Vegetation composition and soil characteristics were measured at P. croceum and P. aurantiacum sites in the Upper Engadine region. P. croceum is best characterized as a pioneer species preferring anthropogenic and naturally disturbed habitats on silicate soils ranging between 1,700 and 2,300 m asl in the study area. Species composition, Landolt indicator values for light availability, soil nitrogen and temperature as well as certain soil properties differed significantly between the sites colonized by native and exotic poppy species, although an overlapping zone exists in glacier forefield habitats of the study area. P. croceum did not express typical traits and characteristics of a disruptive invader. In the Morteratsch glacier forefield, however, it has invaded the primary successional stages but is outcompeted in later stages. Presently, a clear ecological separation is apparent between the native and alien congener indicating limited threat to the native congener. However, climate change, land use change and possible hybridization might alter P. croceum's current status as a non-disruptive invader.","[Irl, Severin D.

Here, we quantified 25 leaf traits of two individual species, Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata (Qa, deciduous) and Quercus spinosa (Qs, evergreen), in the same genus, but with different life-form to investigate the leaf traits and relationship variations within and between species along an altitudinal gradient in the Qinling Mountains. Variations of leaf traits were common along an altitudinal gradient at species level, but with different trends between two species. The relationships between plant functional traits were complex and showed different patterns between two species. Two species show different response patterns and adaptation strategies to environmental gradients. The Qa at high altitude suffers from low temperature stress that breaks its carbon balance and leads to growth restriction, which supports the source-limitation hypothesis, while Qs at high altitude possesses an adequate supply of carbon to protect from stress, which supports the sink- or growth-limitation hypothesis. The effect of environmental change on leaf traits is greater in leaf form than the genetic relationship.","[Chai, Yongfu; Yue, Ming; Liu, Xiao; Li, Qian; Shang, Hailin; Meng, Qiancai] NW Univ Xian, Key Lab Resource Biol & Biotechnol Western China, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaofei] Xian Res Inst China Coal Technol, Environm Protect Res Inst, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaofei] Engn Grp Corp, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruichang] Univ Tubingen, Dept Plant Ecol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany",Northwest University Xi'an; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Yue, M (corresponding author), NW Univ Xian, Key Lab Resource Biol & Biotechnol Western China, Taibai North Rd 229, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yueming@nwu.edu.cn,,,"S&T Basic Work Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2011FY110300]; Forerunner Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050301-4]","S&T Basic Work Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China; Forerunner Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported by S&T Basic Work Program of Ministry of Science and Technology, China (2011FY110300) and Forerunner Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA05050301-4).",,65,11,15,12,107,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1341-6979,1610-7403,,J FOREST RES-JPN,J.

Using information on 74 invasive species in Spain, the aims of this paper are to (1) test whether invasive plant species assemblages follow a nested pattern at the regional scale, (2) inspect the relationship between range size and niche properties (position and breadth) of invasive species to test whether the nested pattern is a product of species niche overlap; and finally (3) examine how species traits of invaders are related to their niche properties. We show that regional invasive plant species assemblages in Spain are organized in nested subsets. Invasive species with restricted range occur in areas invaded by widespread invaders. By relating nestedness metrics to species' niche properties from multivariate analyses, we found that these restricted invaders are less tolerant of broad climatic and landscape conditions than widespread invaders. Finally, regarding the association between niche properties and species traits, we found that species with large environmental niche breadth commonly exhibit non N-fixing strategy, short-life span, and clonal growth, while those with niche position in anthropogenic coastal areas were perennial and clonal species of unintentional and agricultural origin. Using an integrative approach linking the regional spatial structure of invasive plant assemblages, species niche properties and species traits, we were able to understand the potential causes of invasive species distribution in Spain. The approach developed in this research could be easily applied to other areas to disentangle the mechanisms driving invasive species distributions.","[Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Gasso, Nuria; Pino, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CREAF Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Bellaterra 08193, Catalonia, Spain; [Vila, Montserrat] CSIC, EBD, Seville 41092, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD),"Thuiller, W (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",wilfried.thuiller@ujf-grenoble.fr; n.gasso@gmail.com; Joan.Pino@uab.es; montse.vila@ebd.csic.es,"Pino, Joan/H-6253-2015; Vila, Montserrat/D-9339-2013; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Pino, Joan/0000-0003-0939-7502; Vila, Montserrat/0000-0003-3171-8261; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274","European Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-506675, SSPI-CT-2003-511202]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2009-07515, CSD2008-00040]; ANR SCION project [ANR-08-PEXT-03]","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); ANR SCION project(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank I.

Here, we determine how environmental factors, land use, life-history traits of the invaders, residence time, origin, and human usage interact to shape the spatial pattern of invasive alien plant species in South Africa. Relationships between the environmental factors and the extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of species were investigated using RLQ analysis, a multivariate method for relating a species-attribute table to an environmental table by way of a species presence/absence table. We then clustered species according to their position on the RLQ axes, and tested these groups for phylogenetic independence. The first three axes of the RLQ explained 99% of the variation and were strongly related to the species attributes. The clustering showed that, after accounting for environmental factors, the spatial pattern of IAS in South Africa was driven by human uses, life forms, and reproductive traits. The seven clusters of species strongly reflected geographical distribution, but also intrinsic species attributes and patterns of human use. Two of the clusters, centered on the genera Acacia and Opuntia, were phylogenetically non-independent. The remaining clusters comprised species of diverse taxonomic affinities, but sharing traits facilitating invasion in particular habitats. This information is useful for assessing the extent to which the potential spread of recent introductions can be predicted by considering the interaction of their biological attributes, region of origin, and human use.","Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; S African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa; Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; Univ Cape Town, Dept Bot, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; South African National Biodiversity Institute; Stellenbosch University; University of Cape Town,"Thuiller, W (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",wilfried.thuiller@ujf.grenoble.fr,"Wilson, John/B-4101-2008; Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Procheş, Şerban/A-2044-2008; Rouget, Mathieu/B-7249-2008","Wilson, John/0000-0003-0174-3239; Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Procheş, Şerban/0000-0002-3415-6930; Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0003-1836-7727; Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0002-6172-3152",,,,,66,233,242,4,146,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2006,87,7,,,,,1755,1769,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1755:IBESTA]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1755:IBESTA]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,069OK,16922325,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000239457900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most invasion research so far has focused on the properties underlying species invasiveness and community invasibility, yet IAS impact and the underlying causal pathways remain largely unknown. Here we dealt with this knowledge gap by extending the traditional functional trait framework to spectral data, by using traits estimated from reflectance measurements obtained through proximal field spectroscopy, as a surrogate for conventionally measured traits. We focused on two functionally distinct species that are invasive in Belgium: the annual forbImpatiens glanduliferaRoyle, and the rhizomatous perennial forbSolidago giganteaAit. By means of trait-based linear mixed models and structural equation models we studied their impact on six ecosystem functions involved in the cycling of carbon and nutrients, and the mechanisms mediating these changes. Analyses based on either conventionally or optically measured traits revealed similar results: the IAS altered aboveground biomass (decrease and increase underI. glanduliferaandS. gigantearespectively), litter stabilization (decrease under both IAS) and soil available phosphorus (increase under both IAS) through mass ratio effects, rather than through decreasing the functional diversity of the community. WhereasS. giganteadid so by shifting the community towards more conservative traits,I. glanduliferaachieved this by making the community taller and richer in leaf nutrients. The use of remote sensing through optically measured traits, is not only useful to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of plant invasion, but may also be valuable to the broader field linking plant community composition to ecosystem functioning. Its potential for studying larger spatial scales over time may contribute to even more comprehensive insights.","[Van Cleemput, Elisa; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad; Somers, Ben] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Van Cleemput, Elisa] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Helsen, Kenny; Honnay, Olivier] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; KU Leuven,"Van Cleemput, E (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",elisa.vancleemput@colorado.edu,"Somers, Ben/ABG-2016-2020; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/C-9007-2016; Helsen, Kenny/AAE-7555-2020","Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/0000-0002-9260-3815; Helsen, Kenny/0000-0001-6856-7095; Somers, Ben/0000-0002-7875-107X; Honnay, Olivier/0000-0002-4287-8511; Van Cleemput, Elisa/0000-0002-5305-9749","Belgian Science Policy Office [SR/01/321, SR/01/391]; internal KU Leuven funding (Special Research Fund, C1 project)","Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); internal KU Leuven funding (Special Research Fund, C1 project)","We would like to thank everyone who participated in the data collection, in particular Remi Chevalier, Bert Symons and Pieter Meert.

The plots were laid out in 1985-1986 and 1995-1996 on machine-graded ski runs using a total of 8,603 transplants of native grasses, legumes and forbs. Establishment conditions were improved with biodegradable wood-fiber mats and a small addition of garden soil. Transplant survival rates were generally good after 12 years. The regeneration of mixed stands was clearly recognizable because some transplants successfully reproduced by seed, and colonizers immigrated from the adjacent natural vegetation and neighboring restoration plots. Comparative studies of reproductive parameters in transplants and their donor population revealed that differences in seed production may become nonsignificant within a short time span. These fitness features have important diagnostic value for assessing restoration success and provide information on the performance of the same or closely related genotypes in their natural populations and in the restoration site. The plants studied showed species-specific traits in establishment after transplanting. Most species can be recommended for restoration in the alpine vegetation belt. The risk of restoration failure can be considerably reduced by using species with different life-history characteristics. From an ecological point of view, this method is a valid alternative to commercial revegetation using seed mixtures of non-native species and large amounts of fertilizers.","SFIT Zurich, Geobot Inst, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Fattorini, M (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburgerstr 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",,,,,,,,30,31,31,1,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",1061-2971,,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

High-mountain habitats have been particularly useful for evaluation of the relative importance of environmental conditions in the colonization and invasion process, because they have heterogeneous and stressful climatic conditions, inducing photoinhibition. Light intensity is one of the most changing conditions along altitudinal gradients, showing more variability in higher altitudes. In this study, we analyzed the plasticity in photoprotective strategies and performance of the invasive Taraxacum officinale. Additionally, we tested whether higher plasticity enhances competitive ability in an alpine environment We conducted an experiment to evaluate plasticity with a second generation (F2) of T. officinale individuals from 1,600 to 3,600 m, in a greenhouse with variation in light intensity. Treatments consisted of transferring 120 individuals from each altitude to two conditions of light intensity. We then recorded concentrations of photoprotection pigment, de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle, foliar angles, photochemical efficiency by fluorescence of photosystem II, total dry biomass and flower production. Additionally, we compared plasticity in both photoprotective and performance traits between T. officinale and the co-occurring native species Hypochaeris thrincioides. Finally, we performed a manipulative experiment under two light regimes in order to assess the competitive outcome between the invasive T. officinale and the native H. thrincioides. Individuals from higher altitude showed significantly greater plasticity than individuals from lower altitude. Similarly, individuals under high light intensity showed higher levels of photoprotective pigments, biomass and flower production. On the other hand, the invasive plant species showed significantly greater plasticity than the co-occurring native species, and a strong negative impact on the biomass of the native plant. Phenotypic plasticity seems to be a successful strategy in T. officinale to compete with native species and may be positively associated with the success of invasions, being greater in individuals from more heterogeneous and stressful environments.","[Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile; [Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Global Ecol Unit CREAF CEAB CSIC, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Munne-Bosch, Sergi] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); University of Barcelona,"Molina-Montenegro, MA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile.",marco.molina@ceaza.cl,"Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Bosch, Sergi Munne/N-3302-2014; Sardans, Jordi/AEM-0228-2022","Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Bosch, Sergi Munne/0000-0001-6523-6848; Sardans, Jordi/0000-0003-2478-0219; Molina-Montenegro, Marco/0000-0001-6801-8942","Spanish Government [CGL2006-04025/BOS, CGL2010-17172, BFU2009-06045-E]; Consolider-Ingenio Montes [CSD2008-00040]; Catalan Government [SGR 2009-458]",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Consolider-Ingenio Montes(Spanish Government); Catalan Government,"This research was supported by Spanish Government grants CGL2006-04025/BOS, CGL2010-17172, BFU2009-06045-E and Consolider-Ingenio Montes CSD2008-00040 and the Catalan Government grant SGR 2009-458.

Studies on variation in seed traits among populations of an invader along latitudes/longitudes may assist in revealing how invasive plants cope with variable climates. In this study, we collected seeds of 26 populations of the global invasive plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia along ranges spanning 23 degrees latitudes and 20 degrees longitudes that are highly correlated in its invasive range in China. We measured over 20 seed traits, including seed morphology, phytohormone, nutrients, and germination, and investigated how the climate along the latitudes affects those traits. We found that germination time was significantly delayed with increasing latitude and longitude, while the reversed patterns were true for the germination rate. From low to high latitude, seed size, abscisic acid, and fatty acid were increased, likely affecting seed germination. Our analysis further demonstrated that temperature is the dominant driver of the variability in seed traits and germination. Germination rates of larger seeds in cold ranges were lower, while smaller seeds from warm ranges germinated faster, likely indicating adaptive strategies of the invasive plant in seed trait functional ecology. Together, our findings provide new insights into understanding the seed adaptation strategies during the invasion process and the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved.","[Zhou, Lifeng; Yu, Hongwei; Yang, Kaiwen; Chen, Li; Yin, Wandong; Ding, Jianqing] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Adaptat & Improvement, Kaifeng, Peoples R China",Henan University,"Ding, JQ (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Adaptat & Improvement, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.",jding@henu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFC1200100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32001233],National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFC1200100 to JD) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32001233).,,64,8,8,16,72,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

We evaluated whether earlier springs, warmer summers, and extended autumns alter the phenology of leaves and flowers in native and introduced forts and shrubs in the boreal understory and open-canopy habitats, and whether the responses provide an advantage to either group. We tracked the phenology of 29 native and 12 introduced species over three years with very different spring, summer, and autumn conditions. The native species produced flowers (but not leaves) earlier than the introduced species, and both groups advanced leaf-out and flowering in the early-snowmelt year. However, shifts in phenology between early and late years were similar for both groups. There was no increase in fruit development rate for either givup in the warm summer. In contrast, in the year with the extended autumn, the introduced plants extended leaf production and time of senescence much more than native species. While growth form and leaf habit could explain the differences in phenology between native and introduced groups in spring and summer, these traits could not account for differences in autumn. We conclude that in boreal Alaska extended autumns may benefit introduced species more than native ones.","[Mulder, Christa P.

Furthermore, there is little consensus as to whether a plastic response is related to invasiveness in stressful environments. Exotic species have recently been reported in the high Andes of central Chile, where individuals have to cope with drought and poor soils, in addition to extreme temperatures. We explored if the exotic species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) has plastic responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability, and whether two sets of alpine populations derived from native and introduced populations can converge to similar plastic responses to environmental constraints. Using a common garden approach, we compared plants grown from seeds collected in alpine populations of its native range (Alps, France) and in alpine populations of its introduced range (Andes, Chile) under a drought experiment, a potassium gradient, and a nitrogen gradient. Plasticity was only found as a response to drought. Moreover, different responses were found between both origins. Andean individuals are drought-resistant, while individuals from the Alps were drought-sensitive. According to the nutrient experiments, Andean dandelions behave as a nitrogen demanding-potassium avoiding species, whereas individuals from the Alps did not show any particular dependency or repulsion tendency to either of these two nutrients. Results suggest that differences in life history traits of both derived sets of populations may have an important role in determining the response of dandelions under the evaluated conditions. However, the relative importance of genetic adaptation in these responses is still unclear. Although T. officinale is a cosmopolite weed, this is the first study that compares individuals coming from its native and invaded range under stressful conditions.","[Quiroz, Constanza L.; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, ECOBIOSIS, Concepcion, Chile; [Quiroz, Constanza L.; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Choler, Philippe; Baptist, Florence] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Gen Bot, Duisburg, Germany",Universidad de Concepcion; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Duisburg Essen,"Quiroz, CL (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, ECOBIOSIS, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",cquiroz@udec.cl,"Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010; González-Teuber, Marcia/ABH-2318-2021; Choler, Philippe/A-7270-2008","Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020; Choler, Philippe/0000-0002-9062-2721; Molina-Montenegro, Marco/0000-0001-6801-8942",CONICYT; FONDECYT [1030821]; ECOS [C03B05];  [AT-24050159];  [P05-002-F ICM],CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); ECOS; ; ,"We thank L.

Phenotypic variation plays an important role in successful plant invasions. The spread of invasive species over large geographic ranges may be facilitated if plants can match their phenotype to local abiotic conditions. Spartina alterniflora, native to the United States, was introduced into China in 1979 and has spread over 19. of latitude along the eastern coast of China. 2. We studied patterns in vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of S. alterniflora at 22 sites at 11 geographic locations over a latitudinal gradient of similar to 2000 km from Tanggu (39.05 degrees N, high latitude) to Leizhou (20.90 degrees N, low latitude) in China. We further evaluated the basis of phenotypic differences by growing plants from across the range in a common garden for 2 growing seasons. 3. We found distinct latitudinal clines in plant height, shoot density and sexual reproduction across latitude. Some traits exhibited linear relationships with latitude; others exhibited hump-shaped relationships. We identified correlations between plant traits and abiotic conditions such as mean annual temperature, growing degree days, tidal range and soil nitrogen content. However, geographic variation in all but one trait disappeared in the common garden, indicating that variation largely due to phenotypic plasticity. Only a slight tendency for latitudinal variation in seed set persisted for 2 years in the common garden, suggesting that plants may be evolving genetic clines for this trait. 4. Synthesis. The rapid spread of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) in China has probably been facilitated by phenotypic plasticity in growth and reproductive traits. We found little evidence for the evolution of genetic clines in China, even though these exist for some traits in the native range. The considerable variation among clones, within provenances, that persisted in the common garden suggests a potential for the evolution of geographic clines in the future. Low fecundity of low-latitude S. alterniflora populations in China might result in a slower spread at low latitudes, but S. alterniflora is likely to continue to spread rapidly at high latitudes in China and into the Korean peninsula.","[Liu, Wenwen; Maung-Douglass, Keith; Zhang, Yihui] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Key Lab, Fujian 361102, Peoples R China; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA",Xiamen University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Key Lab, Fujian 361102, Peoples R China.",zyh@xmu.edu.cn,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41276078]; U.S. National Science Foundation [OCE 12-37140]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1237140] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank the editors, Professors Richard Mack and David Gibson and four anonymous referees for providing their constructive comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. This line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. It also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation-atmosphere interactions. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant-and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. Updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. This new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species' effects on key ecosystem properties. We hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.","[Perez-Harguindeguy, N.; Diaz, S.; Jaureguiberry, P.; Gurvich, D.

( 2) What plant traits can be used to predict which species are good competitors? We tested the hypothesis that limited native species establishment on ski trails is caused by ( 1) the dominance of Phleum pratense cv. climax (PPC) and ( 2) the asymmetry of competitive interactions. Location: Sub-alpine area in the northern French Alps. Methods: PPC was cultivated outdoors over 2 years with 15 alpine species in a systematic design with high-and low-nutrient soil conditions. For each species relative survival, competitive performance and relationships with plant traits were measured. Results: PPC exerted strong dominance on most of its neighbouring species. Survival performance of Anthyllis vulneraria, Luzula sudetica and Lotus alpinus were dramatically reduced. Results of above-ground competition showed that species were trapped in asymmetric competition. Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens, Alchemilla xanthochlora, Trifolium pratense and Plantago alpina best counteracted PPC. Below-ground competition was more symmetric, particularly at the high nutrient level. Plant traits such as biomass, canopy size and specific leaf area were positively correlated with competitive performance of the species. Conclusion: The study has implications for the management of restored ski trails since PPC may hinder the establishment of native sub-alpine species. Consequently, recommendations should focus on ( 1) maintaining a low proportion or decreasing the proportion of PPC seeds in the revegetation mix and ( 2) reducing soil fertilization. Plant traits and competition experiments can help to predict changes in restored grasslands.","[Isselin-Nondedeu, Francis] Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6565, Lab Chronoenvironm,UFR Sci & Tech, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Isselin-Nondedeu, Francis] Univ Laval, Peatland Ecol Res Grp, Dept Phytol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Isselin-Nondedeu, Francis; Bedecarrats, Alain] Cemagref, Unite Ecosyst Montagnards, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Franche-Comte; Laval University; INRAE,"Isselin-Nondedeu, F (corresponding author), Univ Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6565, Lab Chronoenvironm,UFR Sci & Tech, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",francis.isselin@univ-fcomte.fr; alain.bedecarrats@cemagref.fr,,"Isselin-Nondedeu, Francis/0000-0002-9513-4524",,,,,50,6,6,2,25,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1402-2001,,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

It has only recently appeared on the large alluvial plains of alpine rivers, while it has formed monospecific stands in many habitats. In this study, we investigated some of the biological characteristics of this species in order to predict its invasiveness under the specific environmental conditions of alpine alluvia. When compared to other plants which tend to monopolize space, F. sachalinensis appears to have a life cycle characterized by an early seasonal development. It exhibits a high growth rate - ca. 4 to 5 cm/day, and its productivity is associated with intrinsic characteristics of the species: abundant leaf cover, the appearance of branches when the leaves reach an optimal size on the main stem, and favourable leaf orientation to capture high light intensity. Another morphological characteristic is the presence of a large medullary air cell containing a liquid rich in mineral salts which can be used by the plant when the demand for evaporation increases. Clonal spread associated with an extraordinarily high rate of proliferation of below-ground organs, and mechanisms for adaptation to adverse conditions are biological traits rendering F. sachalinensis an invader in alluvial plains along alpine rivers. There is a risk that such species experience a demographic explosion in the geographical region under study.","Univ Grenoble 1, Ctr Biol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Marigo, G (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, Ctr Biol Alpine, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",gerard.marigo@ujf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,36,11,15,0,22,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

These populations reflect a mosaic of morphological, ecological, and life history traits, and thus represent numerous forms (qualitatively described according to relative body size and ecology). Each population had been previously evaluated for six microsatellite DNA loci, and herein for five meristic counts, four fin pigmentation characters, three body color variables, three measures relating to spawning ecology, an estimate of breeding tubercles, and average weight (= size). The two matrices (genotype vs. phenotype/ecology) were then tested for significance amongst themselves, and against evolutionary and geographic models. Microsatellite data associated significantly with a species flock model in which in situ diversification occurred from a common ancestor in each lake or cluster of neighboring lakes. However, phenotype/ecology associated significantly with a model invoking multiple invasions of lakes by pre-existing forms. The latter supports historic perspectives on the evolution of Central Alpine Coregonus and suggests forms within lakes have adapted to specific within-lake environmental niches that are replicated across lakes. This convergence of form and function has long clouded an understanding of coregonine biodiversity, and we suggest it represents a homoplasious condition (i.e., a similarity due not to genealogy but to iteration). This compendium of homoplasious and homologous characters is actually quite unique in nature, and the evolutionary diversification of Central Alpine Coregonus can now be evaluated according to the relative contribution of each character type.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; ETH Zentrum, Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Sci Phytopathol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Colorado State University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Douglas, MR (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",marlis.douglas@colostate.edu,"Douglas, Michael/T-1761-2019; Brunner, Patrick C/F-5400-2011","Douglas, Michael/0000-0001-9670-7825",,,,,61,19,19,0,4,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAY 9,2005,,2,,,,,347,358,,10.1643/CG-04-128R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CG-04-128R,,,12,Zoology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Zoology,925NR,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000229060300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the unique high-elevation communities of Tenerife (Canary Islands), reproductive success and thus the long-term survival of the speciesmay depend on environmental suitability as well as threat by introduced herbivores. By experimentally modifying the endemic and vulnerable species Viola cheiranthifolia along its entire altitudinal occurrence range, we studied plant performance, autofertility, pollen limitation and visitation rate and the interactive effect of grazing by non-native rabbits on them. We assessed the grazing effects by recording (i) the proportion of consumed plants and flowers along the gradient, (ii) comparing fitness traits of herbivore-excluded plants along the gradient, and (iii) comparing fitness traits, autofertility and pollen limitation between plants excluded from herbivores with unexcluded plants at the same locality. Our results showed that V. cheiranthifolia performance is mainly affected by inter-annual and microhabitat variability along the gradient, especially in the lowest edge. Despite the increasingly adverse environmental conditions, the plant showed no pollen limitation with elevation, which is attributed to the increase in autofertility levels (>= 50% of reproductive output) and decrease in competition for pollinators at higher elevations. Plant fitness is, however, extremely reduced owing to the presence of non-native rabbits in the area (consuming more than 75% of the individuals in some localities), which in turn change plant trait-environment interactions along the gradient. Taken together, these findings indicate that the elevational variation found on plant performance results from the combined action of non-native rabbits with the microhabitat variability, exerting intricate ecological influences that threaten the survival of this violet species.","[Segui, Jaume; Perez, Antonio J.; Traveset, Anna] Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies CSIC UIB, Dept Global Change, C Miquel Marques 21, Mallorca 07190, Balearic Island, Spain; [Lopez-Darias, Marta; Perez, Antonio J.; Nogales, Manuel] Inst Nat Prod & Agrobiol CSIC, Dept Agrobiol & Environm, C Astrofis Fco Sanchez 3, Tenerife 38206, Canary Islands, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao,"Segui, J (corresponding author), Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies CSIC UIB, Dept Global Change, C Miquel Marques 21, Mallorca 07190, Balearic Island, Spain.",jaime.segui.colomar@gmail.com,"Lopez-Darias, Marta/G-3596-2010; Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011; Nogales, Manuel/I-9831-2014","Lopez-Darias, Marta/0000-0002-7611-1298; Nogales, Manuel/0000-0002-5327-3104; Perez-Delgado, Antonio Jose/0000-0002-3797-4058","Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales [785/2012]; European Social Fund (ESF); Government of the Balearic Islands (Conselleria d'Educacio, Cultura i Universitats); JAE Doc programme of the Spanish National Research Council","Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales; European Social Fund (ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Government of the Balearic Islands (Conselleria d'Educacio, Cultura i Universitats); JAE Doc programme of the Spanish National Research Council","Our work was funded by a project of the Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales (785/2012).

To reduce future invasions, it is imperative to determine the naturalization potential of species. Until now, screening approaches have relied largely on species-specific functional feature data. Such information is, however, time-consuming and expensive to collect, thwarting the screening of large numbers of potential invaders. We propose to resolve such data limitations by developing indicators of establishment success of alien species that can be readily derived from open-access databases. These indicators describe key features of successfully established aliens, including estimates of potential range size, niche overlap with human-disturbed environments, and proxies of species traits related to their palaeoinvasions and local dominance capacities. We demonstrate the utility of this new approach by applying it to two large and highly invasive plant groups: Australian acacias and eucalypts. Our results show that these indicators robustly predict establishment successes and failures in each clade independently, and that they can cross-predict establishment in these two clades. Interestingly, the indicator identified as most important was species potential range size on Earth, a variable too rarely considered as a predictor. By successfully identifying key features that predispose Australian plants to naturalize, we provide an objective and cost-effective protocol for flagging high-risk introductions.","[Gallien, Laure; Richardson, David M.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Gallien, Laure] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, LECA Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Thornhill, Andrew H.] James Cook Univ, Australian Trop Herbarium, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Thornhill, Andrew H.; Miller, Joseph T.] Natl Res Collect, Ctr Australian Natl Biodivers Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zurell, Damaris] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Miller, Joseph T.] Natl Sci Fdn, Off Int Sci & Engn, Alexandria, VA 22314 USA",Stellenbosch University; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; James Cook University; Humboldt University of Berlin; National Science Foundation (NSF),"Gallien, L (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.;Gallien, L (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, LECA Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",laure.gallien@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Zurell, Damaris/E-2439-2012; Yeates, David K/A-9917-2008; Thornhill, Andrew/I-3363-2012; Miller, Joseph T./M-2693-2016; Gallien, Laure/G-8384-2014","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Zurell, Damaris/0000-0002-4628-3558; Yeates, David K/0000-0001-7729-6143; Thornhill, Andrew/0000-0002-0325-5725; Miller, Joseph T./0000-0002-5788-9010; Gallien, Laure/0000-0003-4882-1580",DST-NRF Centre for Invasion Biology; National Research Foundation [85417]; German Science Foundation (DFG) [ZU 361/1-1],DST-NRF Centre for Invasion Biology(Department of Science & Technology (India)); National Research Foundation; German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Funding was provided by the DST-NRF Centre for Invasion Biology and the National Research Foundation (grant 85417 to D.M.R.).

Global variation in litter decomposition rates is driven by climate, decomposer taxa and litter quality. Most large-scale studies of litter quality have made comparisons across species, rather than within a species sourced from different latitudes. Here, we aim to explore latitudinal variation in leaf litter decomposition rate and litter quality within a species. 2. We investigated whether the typical interspecific pattern of increased litter lability at higher latitudes also holds within plant species, by comparing leaf litter decomposition rates and litter traits from stands of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora in Chinese coastal wetlands spanning 20 degrees of latitude using parallel greenhouse and field transplant experiments. 3. We found that leaf litter from high-latitude plants decomposed 46.6 +/- 5.1% faster than that from low-latitude conspecifics, with similar patterns in both plant species in both decomposition experiments. Higher lability of leaves from high latitudes was associated with lower levels of plant defensive compounds (phenolics and tannins) and higher levels of nutrients (Ca, Mg and Na). Litter from the exotic S. alterniflora decomposed faster than litter from the native P. australis, being consistent with lower defences and higher nutrient concentrations in S. alterniflora litter. 4. Our results show that individual species follow the same pattern of increasing litter lability at higher latitudes previously reported in cross-species geographical comparisons. Moreover, this pattern can develop rapidly (<4 decades) in an introduced species, raising the question of whether it is caused by phenotypic plasticity or adaptation.","[Zhang, Youzheng; Liu, Zixia; Li, Bo; Wu, Jihua] Fudan Univ, Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Yangtze E, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Youzheng] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, Key Lab Engn Oceanog, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX USA",Fudan University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Wu, JH (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Yangtze E, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jihuawu@fudan.edu.cn,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013; ZHANG, YOUZHENG/AAZ-3685-2020; Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125; Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666; Wu, Jihua/0000-0001-8623-8519; Liu, Zixia/0000-0003-3550-0163","NSFC [32030067, 41871035]; National Science Foundation through the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research program [OCE-1237140]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation through the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research program,Financial support was provided by the NSFC funding (32030067 and 41871035).

Surprisingly, this approach has been, so far, poorly used to understand why some arable weeds are abundant and widespread while others are rare and narrowly distributed. In the present study, we focused on the characteristics of successful weeds occurring in maize fields, one of the most important crops worldwide. Two national weed surveys conducted in France were used to identify increasing and decreasing species based on 175 and 484 surveyed fields in the 1970s and the 2000s, respectively. Weed trait values related to regional frequency, local abundance, and specialization to maize were identified with phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS). We found a positive relationship between regional frequency and local abundance, i.e., the most widespread weeds were also locally more abundant. We highlighted that weeds with the C4 photosynthetic pathway and summer emergence were more abundant, more frequent, and more specialized to maize crops. More generally, we highlighted two successful strategies: On the one hand, traits related to a general weediness syndrome with rapid resource acquisition (high SLA and Ellenberg-N) and high colonization capacity (seed longevity, fecundity, and wind dispersal); on the other hand, traits related to specific adaptation to spring cultivation (thermophilous species with summer emergence, late flowering, and C4 photosynthetic pathway). Deviations from the abundancy-frequency relationships also indicated that species of the Panicoideae sub-family, species with Triazine-resistant populations, and neophyte species were more abundant than expected by their regional frequency. To some extent, it is therefore possible to predict which species can be troublesome in maize crops and use this information in weed risk assessment tools to prevent new introductions or favor early detection and eradication. This study showed how tools developed in functional and macro-ecology can be used to improve our understanding of weed ecology and to develop more preventive management strategies.","[Fried, Guillaume] Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Chauvel, Bruno; Reboud, Xavier] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Univ Bourgogne, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol,INRAE, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement du Travail (ANSES); Laboratoire de la Sante des Vegetaux; INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite de Bourgogne; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie","Fried, G (corresponding author), Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France.",guillaume.fried@anses.fr; bruno.chauvel@inra.fr; fmunoz@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; xavier.reboud@inra.fr,"Fried, Guillaume/B-4777-2015; Munoz, Francois/C-4239-2015","Fried, Guillaume/0000-0002-3653-195X; Munoz, Francois/0000-0001-8776-4705",French Ministry of Agriculture,French Ministry of Agriculture,This study was produced with the support of CESAB-FRB as part of the activities of the DISCO-WEED Working Group.

We explored the potential of hyperspectral leaf reflectance-based methods to predict LMA, LDMC and EWT at the intraspecific level for two herbs (Hieracium umbellatum and Jacobaea vulgaris) and two shrubs (Rosa rugosa and Rubus caesius), based on 2400 leaf samples. More specifically we tested i) inversion of the PROSPECT-D radiative transfer model, ii) a generic PLSR approach using the multibiome LMA PLSR model and iii) a data-specific PLSR approach at the species level. For the latter approach we furthermore assessed both model transferability across species and the trade-off between sample size and model accuracy. Although the PROSPECT-D model inversion and the multibiome LMA PLSR model were relatively accurate for intraspecific LMA predictions of shrubs (R-2 > 71 and 76%, respectively, however NRMSE = 33-47%), their performance was lower for herbs (R-2 < 61%, NRMSE = 28-50%). PROSPECT-D was furthermore slightly less successful in retrieving EWT at the intraspecific level (R-2 < 70%, NRMSE = 16-43%), and unsuccessful in retrieving LDMC through combining LMA and EWT inversion results (R-2 < 10%, NRMSE = 9-192%). The highest correlation accuracy was obtained for all three traits with the species-specific PLSR models (R-2 > 70%, NRMSE < 10%). If high predictive accuracy is needed, we thus suggest the use of species-specific PLSR models. The training of species-specific PLSR models comes at the cost of a needed sample size of 100-160 leaves however, depending on the trait. Although transferability of species-specific PLSR models seems limited overall, our results suggest potentially high transferability across herbaceous species.","[Helsen, Kenny; Honnay, Olivier] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Helsen, Kenny] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 237 Zhoushan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Bassi, Leonardo] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Feilhauer, Hannes; Kattenborn, Teja] Univ Leipzig, Remote Sensing Ctr Earth Syst Res, Talstr 35, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Feilhauer, Hannes] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Remote Sensing, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Matsushima, Hajime] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Van Cleemput, Elisa] Univ Colorado, Inst Arcti & Alpine Res, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80303 USA; [Somers, Ben] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; National Taiwan University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Hokkaido University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; KU Leuven,"Helsen, K (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, Kasteelpk Arenberg 31, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.;Helsen, K (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 237 Zhoushan Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",kenny.helsen@kuleuven.be,"Helsen, Kenny/AAE-7555-2020","Helsen, Kenny/0000-0001-6856-7095; Bassi, Leonardo/0000-0002-2604-8665; Somers, Ben/0000-0002-7875-107X; Honnay, Olivier/0000-0002-4287-8511","Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO) [1202817N, K210519N]",Flemish Fund for Scientific Research (FWO)(FWO),"We thank Stijn Cornelis and Kasper Van Acker for help in the field, and Hannelore Theetaert and VLIZ (Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee) for logistic support in the MSO (Marien Station Oostende), ANB KustPolders for field permits in Belgium and Jean-Baptiste Feret for assistance with data analysis.

A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative.","[Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Chapin, F.

However, the effect of height on fruit and seed traits in invasive vines of Cucurbitaceae has not been intensively studied so far. In Europe, Echinocystis lobata, a North American member of Cucurbitaceae, is considered one of the most abundant invasive alien plants spreading in natural riparian forests, thickets, and tall herbs, whereas it is a rare species in urban woodlands. In this study, we tested the variability of selected fruit and seed traits of E. lobata in connection with habitat origin (natural, semi-natural, and anthropogenic), habitat type (using the EUNIS habitat classification), height (the distance between the fruit and the ground), and geographical position. The study was conducted in 2018 in 65 sites located in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. In each study site, a random sample of 10 fresh mature fruits of E. lobata was collected from subsequent 0.50 m intervals of height. The length, the width, and the weight of the fresh fruits, as well as the total number of seeds and number of undeveloped seeds per fruit, were examined. Moreover, the well-developed seeds from selected study sites were weighed. The statistical analysis showed the significant effect of habitat origin, habitat type, and height on most of the studied fruit and seed traits. The largest range of height (from 0.00 to 4.00 m) was observed in two types of habitats (F-heathland, scrub, and tundra; and G-woodland, forest, and other wooded land). The total number of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with the length, width, and weight of the fresh fruits. The fruits were a little heavier and bigger in natural habitats located in the northeast of the study area. The distribution of fruits at different heights may contribute to better dispersal of seeds by animals and wind, and may also better protect the seeds from being eaten by granivorous animals. The defence against seed-eating animals is expected to be stronger in semi-natural habitats, as well as on banks and shores of inland surface waters, where the seed production is the highest. The influence of seed traits on seed germination and seedling survival in various habitats and their importance in the invasiveness of E. lobata require further study.","[Kostrakiewicz-Gieralt, Kinga] Univ Phys Educ Cracow, Dept Tourism Geog & Ecol, Inst Tourism, Fac Tourism & Recreat, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland; [Pliszko, Artur] Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Taxon Phytogeog & Palaeobotany, Inst Bot, Fac Biol, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Barabasz-Krasny, Beata] Pedag Univ Cracow, Dept Bot, Inst Biol, Fac Exact & Nat Sci, Podchorazych 2, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland; [Bomanowska, Anna] Univ Lodz, Dept Geobotany & Plant Ecol, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Dajdok, Zygmunt; Majk, Jakub; Szczesniak, Ewa] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Bot, Inst Environm Biol, Kanonia 6-8, PL-50328 Wroclaw, Poland; [Gudzinskas, Zigmantas] Nat Res Ctr, Lab Flora & Geobot, Inst Bot, Zaliuju Ezeru 49, LT-12000 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kucharczyk, Marek] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Zool & Nat Conservat, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland; [Mackowiak, Lukasz] Kowalewo 6, PL-64061 Kamieniec, Poland; [Mozdzen, Katarzyna] Pedag Univ Cracow, Dept Plant Physiol, Inst Biol, Fac Exact & Nat Sci, Podchorazych 2, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland; [Podgorska, Monika] Jan Kochanowski Univ Humanities & Sci, Dept Environm Biol, Inst Biol, Fac Exact & Nat Sci, Uniwersytecka 7, PL-25406 Kielce, Poland; [Rasimavicius, Mindaugas] Vilnius Univ, Inst Biosci, Life Sci Ctr, Sauletekio Av 7, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rewicz, Agnieszka] Univ Lodz, Dept Biogeog Paleoecol & Nat Conservat, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Banacha 1-3, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Wojcik, Tomasz] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Agr Sci Land Management & Environm Protect, Dept Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Zelwerowicza 4, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland; [Stachurska-Swakon, Alina] Jagiellonian Univ, Dept Plant Ecol, Inst Bot, Gronostajowa 3, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Pedagogical University of Cracow; University of Lodz; University of Wroclaw; Nature Research Center - Lithuania; Maria Curie-Sklodowska University; Pedagogical University of Cracow; Jan Kochanowski University; Vilnius University; University of Lodz; University of Rzeszow; Jagiellonian University,"Kostrakiewicz-Gieralt, K (corresponding author), Univ Phys Educ Cracow, Dept Tourism Geog & Ecol, Inst Tourism, Fac Tourism & Recreat, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland.",kinga.kostrakiewicz@awf.krakow.pl; artur.pliszko@uj.edu.pl; beata.barabasz-krasny@up.krakow.pl; anna.bomanowska@biol.uni.lodz.pl; zygmunt.dajdok@uwr.edu.pl; zigmantas.gudzinskas@gamtc.lt; marek.kucharczyk@mail.umcs.pl; lukaszmackowiak123@gmail.com; jakub.majk@gmail.com; katarzyna.mozdzen@up.krakow.pl; monika.podgorska@ujk.edu.pl; mindaugas.rasimavicius@gf.vu.lt; agnieszka.rewicz@biol.uni.lodz.pl; ewa.szczesniak@uwr.edu.pl; twojcik@ur.edu.pl; alina.stachurska-swakon@uj.edu.pl,"Kostrakiewicz-Gierałt, Kinga/AAI-5973-2020; Gudžinskas, Zigmantas/ABD-1843-2020","Kostrakiewicz-Gierałt, Kinga/0000-0001-5967-3873; Gudžinskas, Zigmantas/0000-0001-6230-5924; Mozdzen, Katarzyna/0000-0002-5695-4474; Stachurska-Swakon, Alina/0000-0003-0381-4520; Majk, Jakub/0000-0002-5341-1079; Dajdok, Zygmunt/0000-0002-8386-5426; Podgorska, Monika/0000-0003-1777-5534",,,,,93,3,3,6,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,256,10.3390/f13020256,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13020256,,,26,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,ZU0AH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2023-03-22,WOS:000769508600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the damage to Ipomoea flowers was caused by larval Spodoptera spp. that consumed all or parts of the corolla, pistil and stamens. There was no overall difference in damage levels to flowers of the bee or hummingbird-pollinated plants. However, florivores exhibited a strong preference for the native, bumble bee-pollinated L cordatotriloba relative to the remaining three non-native Ipomoea species. The non-native, hummingbird-pollinated I. hederifolia and I. quamoclit consistently experienced the lowest florivory rates. There were reproductive consequences to florivory as damaged flowers had reduced fruit set. Seed set was not influenced by corolla damage, but was reduced when flowers suffered damage to reproductive organs. The results of our study suggest that flower-eating insects are not focusing in on traits associated with different pollination syndromes, but are preferentially visiting the native Ipomoea species, and this may contribute to the Successful invasion of introduced Ipomoea plants that suffer reduced damage levels.","[Sowell, Dexter R.; Wolfe, Lorne M.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"Sowell, DR (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biol, POB 400328, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",dsowell@virginia.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [DEB-0349553]; Georgia Southern University, Graduate College; Georgia Southern University, College of Science and Technology Academic Excellence","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Georgia Southern University, Graduate College; Georgia Southern University, College of Science and Technology Academic Excellence","The authors thank C.

Non-indigenous dwarf pine (Pinus mugo) in the treeline ecotone of the Eastern High Sudetes Mountains and its experimental removal is the model example. We asked how species composition and diversity develop after it is clearcut, and what are the main drivers leading to alpine grasslands restoration. On the study site (Jeseniky Mts., the Czech Republic), three distinct habitats were distinguished: plots after clearcut, alpine grasslands, and dwarf pine plantation. Plant species composition was assessed by means of phytosociological releves together with selected plant traits and environmental factors. We compared temporal trends in species number, diversity, and plant traits among the habitats. Species richness and diversity has increased since the dwarf pine was clearcut. This trend was the same for all three types of habitats studied, although they were significantly different in spatial compositional heterogeneity and species structure. Species composition among study habitats differed and went through its own successive trend of community development during time as the consequence of species turnover. We revealed that light-demanding plant species preferring low nitrogen concentrations were associated with the successional trend after the dwarf pine was clearcut. Dwarf pine removal creates conditions for alpine grassland restoration, but restoration can take a long time because of the environmental conditions, dwarf pine legacy, and plant traits that determine the succession direction.

Along latitudinal gradients, allocation theory predicts that faster flowering onset at high latitudes results in maturation at smaller size and thus reduced reproductive output. For annual invasive plants, more favourable environmental conditions at low latitudes probably result in stronger competition of co-occurring species, potentially driving selection for higher investment in vegetative biomass, while harsher climatic conditions and associated reproductive uncertainty at higher latitudes could reduce selection for vegetative biomass and increased selection for high reproductive investment (stress-gradient hypothesis). Combined, these drivers could result in increased or constant reproductive allocation with increasing latitude. Methods We quantified life-history traits in the invasive annual plant Impatiens glandidifera along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. By growing two successive glasshouse generations, we assessed genetic differentiation in vegetative growth and reproductive output across six populations, and tested whether onset of flowering chives this divergence. Key Results Trait variation was mainly caused by genetic differentiation. As expected, flowering onset was progressively earlier in populations from higher latitudes. Plant height and vegetative biomass also decreased in populations from higher latitudes, as predicted by allocation theory, but their variation was independent of the variation in flowering onset. Reproductive output remained constant across latitudes, resulting in increased reproductive allocation towards higher latitudes, supporting the stress-gradient hypothesis. We also observed trait genetic differentiation among populations that was independent of latitude. Conclusions We show that an annual invasive plant evolved several life-history traits across its invaded range in similar to 150 years.

The rapid invasion of the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora in China during the last 36 yr is a test case for the roles of these mechanisms. A previous study of S. alterniflora in China found strong latitudinal clines in vegetative and sexual traits and concluded that most of this variation was due to phenotypic plasticity. Recent observations suggested provenance-by-environment interactions, and we employed common gardens at multiple latitudes as a test of this idea. Phenotypically, field plant height, which correlates strongly with biomass and other indices of vegetative performance in this species, showed a hump-shaped relationship across 10 sites, covering 19 degrees of latitude; field seed set increased linearly with latitude. To assess the role of plasticity vs. genetic differentiation in these patterns, we grew plants from the ten field sites in three common gardens at low (20.9 degrees N), mid (28.3 degrees N), and high (38.0 degrees N) latitudes to maturity, at 18 months. Plant height varied among common gardens, with the tallest plants at mid latitude, mirroring the field pattern, consistent with the previous study. Within the gardens, latitude of origin also affected plant height. Seed set varied among the gardens, with the greatest values at high latitudes, again mirroring the field pattern and indicating substantial plasticity. Evidence of evolution was found as increasing seed set with latitude among provenances within common gardens. However, the effect differed among common gardens, with the greatest slope in the high-latitude garden, lower slope in the mid-latitude garden, and no relationship in the low-latitude garden, indicating a provenanceby- environment interaction. The number of surviving plants also suggested a provenance-byenvironment interaction; no relationship with latitude among provenances in the two southern gardens and increasing survival with latitude in the northern garden. Field seedling density was similar to 200-fold greater at high than at low latitude sites. The profuse seed germination and recruitment in the north could have created high selection intensity resulting in evolution of reproductive traits at high latitudes with the result that the mechanisms of the invasion differ with latitude.","[Liu, Wenwen; Zhang, Yihui] Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Key Lab, Coll Environm & Ecol, Fujian 361102, Peoples R China; [Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Pennings, Steven C.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA",Xiamen University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Key Lab, Coll Environm & Ecol, Fujian 361102, Peoples R China.",zyh@xmu.edu.cn,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41276078, 31470485]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720150097]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China [2014J01140]; U.S. National Science Foundation [OCE 12-37140]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1237140] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Q.

The Sierra Nevada has been heavily impacted for more than a century and a half, first by heavy grazing up into high elevation meadows, followed by major logging, and finally, by impacts associated with recreational use. The comparative elevational patterns of distribution and growth form were compared for native and alien plant species in the four families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae) that contribute the majority of naturalized aliens in the study area. The distribution of realized climatic niche breadth, as measured by elevational range of occurrence, was virtually identical for alien and native species, with both groups showing a roughly Gaussian distribution peaking with species whose range covers a span of 1500-1999 m. In contrast to alien species, which only rarely occurred at higher elevations, native species showed a distribution of upper elevation limits peaking at 3000-3499 m, an elevation that corresponds to the zone of upper montane and subalpine forests. Consistent with a hypothesis of abiotic limitations, only a few alien species have been ecologically successful invaders at subalpine and alpine elevations above 2500 m. The low diversity of aliens able to become established in these habitats is unlikely due to dispersal limitations, given the long history of heavy grazing pressure at high elevations across this region. Instead, this low diversity is hypothesized to be a function of life history traits and multiple abiotic stresses that include extremes of cold air and soil temperature, heavy snowfall, short growing seasons, and low resource availability. These findings have significant implications for resource managers.","[Rundel, Philip W.; Keeley, Jon E.] Univ Calif UCLA, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Keeley, Jon E.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Sequoia Kings Canyon Field Stn, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Keeley, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif UCLA, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Keeley, JE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Sequoia Kings Canyon Field Stn, Three Rivers, CA 93271 USA.",jon_keeley@usgs.gov,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,37,NATURAL AREAS ASSOC,ROCKFORD,"320 SOUTH THIRD ST, ROCKFORD, IL 61104 USA",0885-8608,2162-4399,,NAT AREA J,Nat.

Location The New Zealand archipelago. Methods An analysis of the factors correlated with distribution and endemism for alpine plants within New Zealand, and for the New Zealand biota as a whole. Results Woody plants are highly endemic; nonendemic plants tend to be herbaceous and are concentrated among the highly dispersible ferns and fern allies, orchids and wetland plants. These groups make up 32% of the total flora but contribute 78% of nonendemics. Alpine plants with wide spatial distribution tend to have greater altitudinal ranges, a broader habitat preference and better dispersal ability. Main conclusions Most vascular plants reached New Zealand by long-distance transoceanic dispersal, probably during the Late Miocene to early Pleistocene period. During the Miocene and Pliocene, similar climates and landscapes to those of Australia and northern island groups, and highly invasible terrain, permitted dispersal of woody plants. Cooling climates and formation of a more mountainous, more compact landscape after that time reduced dispersal of woody plants and favoured herbaceous, wetland and highly dispersible plant groups. The prominence of dispersal has led to intense selective immigration, and is responsible for many characteristic features of the flora. Species selection by glacial-interglacial cycles has restricted acquisition or retention of cool or arid climate adaptations, particularly in the lowland flora. Endemic and range disjunction patterns in the New Zealand mainland are not, in general, directly caused by Pliocene inundations or the faulting and associated horizontal displacement of terrain that has continued since the Miocene. They have arisen mainly through Pleistocene extinctions, speciation and dispersal, and some patterns are strongly linked to repeated glaciation. Endemic centres are associated with differentiated terrain and climates providing isolation, distinctive environments, and habitat continuity conducive to speciation.","Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand; Lincoln Univ, Soil Plant & Ecol Sci Div, Ecol & Evolutionary Grp, Canterbury, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"McGlone, MS (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 69, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand.",,"Duncan, Richard/ABD-4099-2020; Heenan, Peter/AAS-1048-2021; Duncan, Richard P/E-7899-2013","Duncan, Richard/0000-0003-2295-449X; Heenan, Peter/0000-0001-8229-7466; Duncan, Richard P/0000-0003-2295-449X",,,,,104,201,210,2,95,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

In the absence of specialist herbivores, it is believed that invasive plants may allocate fewer resources to resistance and more to growth and reproduction, thus increasing tolerance to damage in the invasive genotypes. In order to test these predictions, we compared both performance (growth and reproduction) and defense strategies (tolerance and resistance) of two populations of Taraxacum officinale, one from the native range in the French Alps, and one from the introduced range in the Chilean Andes. Individuals from the introduced population demonstrated improved reproductive traits relative to those from the native population, although there was no discernible difference in biomass accumulation. Additionally, reduced tolerance was evident in the case of the former; whereas fitness traits of native plants were unaffected by damage, invasive plants reduced growth and seed output by 25 and 30% respectively following damage treatments. Increases in levels of phenols and anthocyanins, produced as a defense response to herbivory, were observed in introduced plants. Our results suggest that reallocation of resources to reproduction may be an important factor favouring invasive success of T. officinale in Chile, and that a higher investment in chemical resistance traits in this population may also be a factor in this regard.","[Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile; [Quiroz, Constanza L.] Univ San Sebastian, Escuela Terapia Ocupac, Fac Ciencias Salud, Lientur 1457, Concepcion 4080871, Chile; [Concha-Bloomfield, Isabel; Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Cavieres, Lohengrin A.] IEB, Santiago 3465, Chile",Universidad de La Serena; Universidad San Sebastian; Universidad de Concepcion,"Gonzalez-Teuber, M (corresponding author), Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Casilla 554, La Serena, Chile.",mfgonzalez@userena.cl,"González-Teuber, Marcia/ABH-2318-2021; Cavieres, Lohengrin/A-9542-2010","Cavieres, Lohengrin/0000-0001-9122-3020",CONICYT [PFB-023]; FONDECYT [1130952]; F ICM [P05-02],CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); F ICM,"This research was funded by CONICYT doctoral Fellowship to C.L.

The latter is modifying the distribution of the former, and the magnitude and direction of distributional changes are predicted to vary depending on species dispersal mode. Here, we address the question of whether clonality is expected to affect the future invasion pattern in PAs. Location Worldwide. Time period 1950-2100. Major taxa studied 36 invasive alien plant species. Methods We used ensembles of three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and Maxent) based on >70,000 occurrence records to project the distribution of 36 of the world's most invasive clonal and non-clonal plants in >20,000 PAs. Projections were based on three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (low, medium and high) for 2080. Results Climate change showed little impact on the global invasion pattern in PAs, and clonality showed little effect when all biomes were processed in concert. However, we discerned that the future invasion risk of clonal IAPS markedly increased in biomes located at high elevation and high latitude compared with non-clonal IAPS, while the risk decreased in lower-elevation tropical and subtropical biomes where asexual reproduction may be a less successful trait. We also showed that invasion hot spots overlapped with biodiversity hot spots and two realms (i.e. Nearctic and Palearctic), which calls for bridging the gap between invasion and conservation sciences and for more concerted management strategies. Main conclusions We suggest that effective management of IAPS in PAs should consider in which biomes PAs are located as well as the reproductive traits of IAPS that are present or may become so.","[Wan, Ji-Zhong; Wang, Chun-Jing; Pouteau, Robin; Yu, Fei-Hai] Taizhou Univ, Inst Wetland Ecol & Clone Ecol, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Wan, Ji-Zhong; Wang, Chun-Jing] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining, Peoples R China; [Wan, Ji-Zhong] Pontifical Univ Catholic Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Wan, Ji-Zhong] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Taizhou University; Qinghai University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Yu, FH (corresponding author), Taizhou Univ, Inst Wetland Ecol & Clone Ecol, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.",feihaiyu@126.com,"Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008","Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","Ten Thousand Talent Program of Zhejiang Province [2018R52016]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870610, 32071527]; Joint Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation [LTZ20C030001]",Ten Thousand Talent Program of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Joint Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation,"This study was supported by the Ten Thousand Talent Program of Zhejiang Province (2018R52016), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870610, 32071527) and the Joint Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (LTZ20C030001).

Their fitness consequences in animal populations, however, are not sufficiently well understood, despite hybridisation rates becoming increasingly important worldwide following human-related activities such as domestication, game management and habitat alteration. In Europe, the density and distribution of native ungulates have largely been influenced by humans since pre-historic times. This, alongside the introduction of non-native and domesticated species, may bear major consequences at the genetic and population levels. We provide an updated overview of recent hybridisation events in wild European ungulates; we describe their ecological drivers, extent, current distribution, potential consequences and proposed management strategies. We reviewed the scientific literature published between 2000 and 2018 and found that confirmed hybridisation was described in 75 of the 89 references we included, involving nearly all the species that we investigated. Most researchers relied on genetic information for hybrid identification, which often involved a domestic counterpart. However, introductions and translocations also led to crossbreeding between wild ungulate (sub)species. Only 43 papers provided management recommendations, mostly focused on preventing hybridisation and removing hybrids. Hybridisation proved to be relatively common in several ungulate taxa in Europe. Despite reported changes in phenotype and fitness-related traits in some species, the consequences of hybridisation for adaptation, life history, and evolutionary potential remain largely unknown. The current conservation paradigm aims to prevent the spread of domestic or non-native genes in native populations; accordingly, conservation plans should: 1) determine the genetic origin of possible source populations; 2) protect native populations from the risk of crossbreeding with non-native ones, and 3) establish permanent monitoring.","[Iacolina, Laura] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Frederik Bajers Vej 7H, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Iacolina, Laura] Aalborg Zoo, Molleparkvej 63, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Corlatti, Luca] Univ Freiburg, Wildlife Ecol & Management, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Corlatti, Luca] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Buzan, Elena] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Biodivers, Glagoljaska 8, Koper 6000, Slovenia; [Safner, Toni] Univ Zagreb, Dept Plant Breeding Genet & Biometr, Fac Agr, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Sprem, Nikica] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Fisheries Beekeeping Game Management & Speci, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia","Aalborg University; University of Freiburg; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Primorska; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb","Iacolina, L (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Frederik Bajers Vej 7H, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.;Iacolina, L (corresponding author), Aalborg Zoo, Molleparkvej 63, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",lauraiacolina@gmail.com; luca.corlatti@wildlife.uni-freiburg.de; elena.buzan@famnit.upr.si; tsafner@gmail.com; nsprem@agr.hr,"Corlatti, Luca/AAP-1047-2021; Iacolina, Laura/P-8530-2016","Corlatti, Luca/0000-0002-2706-3875; Iacolina, Laura/0000-0001-5504-6549; Safner, Toni/0000-0001-8645-5273; Buzan, Elena/0000-0003-0714-5301",EU Horizon 2020 (MSCA-IF) [656697]; Croatian Science Foundation [IP 2016-06-5751],EU Horizon 2020 (MSCA-IF); Croatian Science Foundation,"The authors acknowledge funding provided to LI by EU Horizon 2020 (MSCA-IF grant n. 656697) and to NS by the Croatian Science Foundation (project IP 2016-06-5751), and thank M.

Location Three research sites in the continental inland of West Greenland. Methods Based on spatially constrained clustering of 147 vegetation releves and 145 transect plots of plant communities, boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were assessed. Indicators for altitudinal sections were identified from 664 vegetation releves among vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and plant functional types using indicator species analysis. The performance of different plant groups along the altitudinal gradient was visualized with response curves. Results Boundaries of altitudinal vegetation belts were detected at 400, 800 and 1175 m a.s.l. on north-facing slopes and at 450, 900 and 1250 m a.s.l. on south-facing slopes. The resulting four vegetation belts were well defined by 99 indicator species and nine indicator plant functional types. Species, plant functional types and vascular plant distribution types showed clear sequences along the altitudinal gradient, which partly resemble their distribution along the latitudinal gradient. Conclusions As an easily observable expansion of shrubs and a decline of mosses and lichens is expected, the boundary at 400/450 m a.s.l. is particularly promising for climate change monitoring. The anticipated replacement of numerous cryophilous by thermophilous indicator species, as well as an obvious shift of plant functional types suggest several monitoring options at 800/900 m a.s.l. The summit areas above 1175/1250 m a.s.l., having a discontinuous plant cover, are considered to be especially vulnerable to fast invasion by species of lower altitudes such as woody plants and sedges. Due to steep gradients and short migration distances in mountains, it can be assumed that these anticipated changes in the study area will be stronger and faster than the already observed changes along the latitudinal gradient in lowland areas of the Arctic.","[Jedrzejek, Birgit; Hoelzel, Norbert] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Drees, Birgit; Daniels, Fred J.

These communities are uniformly sensitive to top-down controls and exhibit rapid changes in plant composition when the intensity and frequency of these controls are altered. These changes are intensifying due to the suite of global change factors, including the continued presence and introduction of new plant species. Establishment of nonnative plant species into grasslands requires resource opportunities generated by natural and human-induced disturbances and by niche differences of the new species. Persistence and spatial expansion require that the traits of the introduced species be compatible with a new regime of competitors, predators, pathogens, and symbionts. Plant traits of the invaders may then further facilitate the invasion process by preempting resources or by restructuring the soil microbial community and trophic food web in ways that directly or indirectly benefit the invading species.","[Seastedt, T.

To identify potential future invasive species, we need to better understand the mechanisms underlying the abundances of invasive tree species in their new ranges, and whether these mechanisms differ between their native and alien ranges. Here, we test two hypotheses: that greater relative abundance is promoted by (a) functional difference from locally co-occurring trees, and (b) higher values than locally co-occurring trees for traits linked to competitive ability. Location Global. Time period Recent. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods We combined three global plant databases: sPlot vegetation-plot database, TRY plant trait database and Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database. We used a hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model to assess the factors associated with variation in local abundance, and how these relationships vary between native and alien ranges and depend on species' traits. Results In both ranges, species reach highest abundance if they are functionally similar to co-occurring species, yet are taller and have higher seed mass and wood density than co-occurring species. Main conclusions Our results suggest that light limitation leads to strong environmental and biotic filtering, and that it is advantageous to be taller and have denser wood. The striking similarities in abundance between native and alien ranges imply that information from tree species' native ranges can be used to predict in which habitats introduced species may become dominant.","[van der Sande, Masha T.; Klotz, Stefan; Knight, Tiffany M.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [van der Sande, Masha T.; Bruelheide, Helge; Haider, Sylvia; Purschke, Oliver; Winter, Marten; Jandt, Ute; Kattge, Jens; Klotz, Stefan; Knight, Tiffany M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [van der Sande, Masha T.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [van der Sande, Masha T.] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Sande, Masha T.; Kramer, Koen] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bruelheide, Helge; Haider, Sylvia; Purschke, Oliver; Jandt, Ute; Knight, Tiffany M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Dawson, Wayne] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England; [Dengler, Juergen] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany; [Dengler, Juergen] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Inst Environm & Nat Resources IUNR, Vegetat Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Essl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Field, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham, England; [van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Constance, Germany; [van Kleunen, Mark] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Kreft, Holger; Weigelt, Patrick] Univ Goettingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Kreft, Holger] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany; [Pagel, Joern] Univ Hohenheim, Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Pergl, Jan; Pysek, Petr; Petrik, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Pysek, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Ecol, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Attorre, Fabio; De Sanctis, Michele] Univ Sapienza Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Rome, Italy; [Aubin, Isabelle] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada; [Bergmeier, Erwin] Univ Gottingen, Vegetat & Phytodivers Anal, Gottingen, Germany; [Chytry, Milan] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic; [Dainese, Matteo] Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Dainese, Matteo] EURAC Res, Inst Alpine Environm, Bolzano, Italy; [Fagundez, Jaime] Univ A Coruna, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Coruna, Spain; [Golub, Valentin] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Ecol Volga River Basin, Tolyatti, Russia; [Guerin, Greg R.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Terrestrial Ecosyst Res Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Gutierrez, Alvaro G.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Agron, Dept Ciencias Ambientales & Recursos Nat Renovabl, Santiago, Chile; [Jansen, Florian] Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Rostock, Germany; [Jimenez-Alfaro, Borja] Univ Oviedo, CSIC, UO PA, Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kearsley, Elizabeth] Univ Ghent, Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol CAVElab, Ghent, Belgium; [Kramer, Koen] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res Alterra, Vegetat Forest & Landscape Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Moretti, Marco] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Chair Crop Sci & Plant Biol, Tartu, Estonia; [Niinemets, Ulo] Estonian Acad Sci, Tallinn, Estonia; [Peet, Robert K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF, Barcelona, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Barcelona, Spain; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Sandel, Brody] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Schmidt, Marco] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Data & Modelling Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schmidt, Marco] Palmengarten Stadt Frankfurt, Sci Serv, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sibikova, Maria] Slovak Acad Sci, Plant Sci & Biodivers Ctr, Inst Bot, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175,CNRS,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Whitfeld, Timothy J.

We conducted a common garden experiment to examine genetically based differentiation in growth and biomass allocation among three native Alternanthera philoxeroides varieties (Alternanthera philoxeroides var. obtusifolia, Alternanthera philoxeroides var. acutifolia and Alternanthera philoxeroides var. lancifolia) from Argentina. Results showed that the high-latitude var. obtusifolia had lower values of relative growth rate and plant size. In contrast, the low-latitude var. acutifolia showed distinctly higher growth vigor. The mid-latitude var. lancifolia generally showed intermediate growth vigor. Regarding allocation, var. obtusifolia allocated a distinctly higher proportion of biomass to storage roots and leaves, whereas var. acutifolia and var. lancifolia allocated more biomass to stems. This pattern of variation might be the outcome of evolutionary differentiation in response to their geographic distributions and local habitats. The acutifolia and lancifolia varieties may have higher potential invasiveness than var. obtusifolia.","[Jia, Xin; Pan, Xiao-Yun; Li, Bo; Chen, Jia-Kuan] Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Sosa, Alejandro] USDA ARS, S Amer Biol Control Lab, RA-1686 Hurlingham Buenos Aires, Argentina",Fudan University,"Pan, XY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ,Inst Biodivers Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xypan@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Bo/AAA-8968-2020; Sosa, Alejandro/AAM-7572-2020; Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-7294-6888; Sosa, Alejandro/0000-0002-1680-8712; Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666",National Basic Research Program of China [2009CB119201]; Public Research and Development Program for Environment [200709017]; Natural Science Foundation of China [30400052],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Public Research and Development Program for Environment; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank Dr Long Tang and Yang Gao for their help during the experiment.

An urgent question is whether native herbivores are able to inhibit the spread of these alien species thus providing biotic resistance. The potential for biotic resistance to these plants depends on plant traits that affect palatability to herbivores, i.e., plant nutritional quality and the presence of secondary metabolites related to anti-herbivory defenses. Studies across latitudinal gradients suggest that aquatic plants from lower latitudes may be less nutritious and better defended than high latitude plants. Therefore, we hypothesized that native herbivores prefer temperate plants over plants from tropical and subtropical regions which would limit the strength of biotic resistance that native temperate herbivores can provide against alien tropical and subtropical plants. Drawing upon the published literature we (1) investigated whether native temperate herbivores reduce the establishment or performance of tropical and subtropical alien plants in the field, and (2) analyzed herbivore consumption of tropical and subtropical versus temperate plants in laboratory feeding trials. In our literature survey, we found only three field studies which, in contrast to our hypothesis, all demonstrated that the native herbivores (beavers, coots or generalist insect herbivores) significantly reduced the success of invading tropical and subtropical plant species. The analysis of the feeding trials yielded mixed results. Ten out of twelve feeding trials showed that (sub) tropical and temperate plants were consumed in equal amounts by both temperate and tropical generalist ectothermic herbivores. The remaining trials showed higher consumption rate of both temperate and tropical plants by tropical snails. Although a body of evidence suggests that tropical plants are nutritionally poor and better defended (i.e., less palatable) compared to temperate plants, we conclude that in the majority of cases, herbivores would eat tropical plants as much as temperate plants. Thus, in agreement with the available field studies, evidence suggests that there is potential for biotic resistance from native generalist herbivores to tropical invasive plants in non-tropical areas.","[Petruzzella, Antonella; Grutters, Bart M.

Some invasive plant species are among the most widely distributed plants worldwide. Plasticity and local adaptation could be the mechanisms for colonising new areas. Aims: We addressed if Taraxacum officinale from native (Alps) and introduced (Andes) stock responded similarly to drought treatment, in terms of photosynthesis, foliar angle, and flowering time. We also evaluated if ontogeny affected fitness and physiological responses to drought. Methods: We carried out two common garden experiments with both seedlings and adults (F2) of T. officinale from its native and introduced ranges in order to evaluate their plasticity and ecotypic differentiation under a drought treatment. Results: Our data suggest that the functional response of T. officinale individuals from the introduced range to drought is the result of local adaptation rather than plasticity. In addition, the individuals from the native distribution range were more sensitive to drought than those from the introduced distribution ranges at both seedling and adult stages. Conclusions: These results suggest that local adaptation may be a possible mechanism underlying the successful invasion of T. officinale in high mountain environments of the Andes.","[Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile; [Quiroz, Constanza L.] Univ Concepcion, Lab Invas Biol, Concepcion, Chile; [Torres-Diaz, Cristian] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Ciencias Nat, Lab Genom & Biodiversidad LGB, Chillan, Chile; [Atala, Cristian] Univ Concepcion, Dept Ciencia & Tecnol Vegetal, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad del Bio-Bio; Universidad de Concepcion,"Molina-Montenegro, MA (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Coquimbo, Chile.",mam-m@ceaza.cl,,"Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534; Molina-Montenegro, Marco/0000-0001-6801-8942; Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288",MECESUP UCO [0214],MECESUP UCO,We thank Ernesto Gianoli and Fernando Valladares for their valuable comments on early versions of the manuscript.

However, it is not yet known how associations between AMF and invasive plant populations change in mountains ranges and how changed associations affect further expansion of different populations in new habitats. We conducted a field survey to detect AMF colonization rate of the invasive Galinsoga quadriradiata along an elevational gradient ranging from 223 to 1947 masl in the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, China. Additionally, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to compare plant growth performance among five elevational populations. In the field, total plant mass and seed production, as well as root AMF colonization rate, significantly decreased with elevation. When populations were grown in a novel soil environment in the greenhouse, the high-altitude populations achieved higher seed and total mass at lower AMF colonization rate than the low-altitude populations. Moreover, high AMF association was related to high intraspecific competition within low-altitude populations and limited seed production. Our results revealed that the associations between AMF and G. quadriradiata decrease with altitude in mountain ranges, and this may indicate that differentiation of association between AMF and elevational populations occurs during range expansion of G. quadriradiata. The results of the greenhouse experiment suggest that the high-altitude populations are more aggressive than the low-altitude populations in a non-stressful environment.","[Liu, Gang; Liu, Rui-Ling; Zhang, Wen-Gang; Yang, Ying-Bo; Bi, Xiao-Qiong; Li, Ming-Zhu; Chen, Xiao-Yan; Zhu, Zhi-Hong] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Key Lab, Minist Educ Med Resources & Nat Pharmaceut Chem, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Nie, Hua] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Math & Informat Sci, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Shaanxi Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University,"Liu, G (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Liu, G (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Key Lab, Minist Educ Med Resources & Nat Pharmaceut Chem, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",2003liugang@163.com; zhuzhihong@snnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Xiao/GQA-8928-2022; Yang, Yingbo/HOF-6033-2023; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022","Chen, Xiao/0000-0002-9797-8384; Yang, Yingbo/0000-0001-6707-7983; Liu, Gang/0000-0002-5633-4216","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600445, 31570425, 31500415, 11671243]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2020JM-286]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK201703036, 2019CSLY019, 2020CSLY014]; China Scholarship Council [201906875024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600445, 31570425, 31500415, and 11671243), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2020JM-286), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (GK201703036, 2019CSLY019, and 2020CSLY014).

Seed germination traits contribute to clarification of invasion dynamics. The objective of this research was to analyze how different light conditions (i.e., 12-hr light/12-hr darkness and continuous darkness) and temperature regimes (i.e., 15/6 degrees C, 20/10 degrees C and 30/20 degrees C) trigger seed germination ofAilanthus altissima(AA),Phytolacca americana(PA) andRobinia pseudoacacia(RP). The relationship between seed germination and seed morphometric traits was also analyzed. Our findings highlight that temperature rather than light was the main environmental factor affecting germination. RP germinated at all tested temperatures, whereas at 15/6 degrees C seeds of AA and PA showed physiological dormancy. RP had a higher germination capacity at a lower temperature, unlike AA and PA, which performed better at the highest temperatures. Light had a minor role in seed germination of the three species. Light promoted germination only for seeds of PA, and final germination percentage was 1.5-fold higher in light than in continuous darkness. Seed morphometric traits (thickness [T], area [A] and volume [V]) had a significant role in explaining germination trait variations. The results highlight the importance of increasing our knowledge on seed germination requirements to predict future invasiveness trends. The increase in global temperature could further advantage AA and PA in terms of germinated seeds, as well as RP by enhancing the germination velocity, therefore compensating for a lower germination percentage of this species at the highest temperatures.","[Pepe, Maria; Gratani, Loretta; Fabrini, Giuseppe; Varone, Laura] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Pepe, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Environm Biol, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",maria.pepe@uniroma1.it,,"Varone, Laura/0000-0002-9989-5283; Pepe, Maria/0000-0003-3187-8767",,,,,129,6,6,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0913-557X,1442-1984,,PLANT SPEC BIOL,Plant Spec.

We investigated how spring precipitation and soil conditions interact with summer drought and affect the establishment of conifer seedlings from different climatic origin. Emergence, establishment and subsequent performance of seedlings originating from autochthonous, Central Alpine, continental Eastern European, and Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies populations were studied in the dry Alpine Rhine valley, Switzerland, at three sites with differing soil water holding capacities and in 3 years with contrasting weather conditions. In addition to this natural inter-annual variation, precipitation was manipulated within sites with throughfall reduction roofs. Seedling establishment and growth were principally affected by the spring weather in the year of emergence. In years with average to positive spring water balance, seedlings grown at the site with the highest water holding capacity had 2-5 times more aboveground biomass than seedlings grown at sites with less favourable soils. Effects of seed origin were marginal and only detectable at the drier sites: contrary to our expectations, seedlings from the Central Alpine Rhone valley, where the climatic spring water deficit is large, outperformed those from the Mediterranean. Consequently, plantation of non-native populations from dryer origin will mitigate the effects of increased summer drought at driest sites only, while the inter-annual variability of spring precipitation will continue to enable temperate conifers to regenerate on a wide range of forest soils independent of seed origin.","[Moser, Barbara; Walthert, Lorenz; Metslaid, Marek; Wasem, Ulrich; Wohlgemuth, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Metslaid, Marek] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Forestry & Rural Engn, Tartu, Estonia","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Estonian University of Life Sciences","Moser, B (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",barbara.moser@wsl.ch,"Moser, Barbara/GLS-7873-2022; Metslaid, Marek/G-6782-2016; Moser, Barbara/G-7232-2015; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/E-6588-2016","Moser, Barbara/0000-0002-4305-7192; Metslaid, Marek/0000-0003-3384-2717; Moser, Barbara/0000-0002-4305-7192; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/0000-0002-4623-0894",BAFU/WSL initiative Wald und Klimawandel; Amt fur Wald und Naturgefahren des Kantons Graubunden; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT21-4],"BAFU/WSL initiative Wald und Klimawandel; Amt fur Wald und Naturgefahren des Kantons Graubunden; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",The project was funded by the BAFU/WSL initiative Wald und Klimawandel and the Amt fur Wald und Naturgefahren des Kantons Graubunden.

In the Italian Alps, we studied plant diversity, forage value and trophic traits in six large-scale heterogeneously grazed Nardus pastures, in their central and peripheral parts, and across the montane, lower and upper subalpine zones. Seventy cover-abundance floristic releves were performed in randomly located permanent plots, half at the pasture edge (M-plots) and half in their central part (C-plots). Plant diversity varied significantly with respect to the distance from the edge, being higher in M-plots because of shrub invasion as a consequence of reduced cattle pressure. Nardus cover was slightly higher in C-plots and negatively related to plant diversity. Forage value was lower in M-plots and negatively correlated with the cover of Nardus and woody species, implying that different grazing pressure was negatively influencing sward productivity. Differences in trophic traits of swards between C- and M-plots existed mostly as trends. Forage value significantly decreased in the lower subalpine and montane pastures, which are further grazed in late summer. Heterogeneous grazing management was therefore exerting positive effects on plant diversity and negative effects on forage value.

We here add a new dimension to large-scale tests of community invasibility, investigating the role that previously established alien species play in facilitating or hindering new invasions in plant communities. LocationPermanent grasslands across France (including mainland and Corsica), as a receding ecosystem of great conservation importance. MethodsFocusing on 121 alien plant species occurring in 7,215 vegetation plots, we quantified biotic similarity between new invaders and resident alien species (i.e., alien species with longer residence times) based on phylogenetic and trait distances. Additionally, we calculated distances to native species for each alien species and plot. Using multispecies distribution models, we analysed the influence of these biotic similarity measures and additional covariates on establishment success (presence/absence) of new invaders. ResultsWe found that biotic similarity to resident alien species consistently increased establishment success of more recently introduced species. Phylogenetic relatedness to previous invaders had an equally strong positive effect as relatedness to native species. Conversely, trait similarity to natives hindered alien establishment as predicted by Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. These results highlight that various mechanisms may act simultaneously to determine alien establishment success. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that, with greater similarity among alien species, invasion success increases. Such a pattern may arise either due to actual facilitation among invaders or as a result of weaker competitive interactions among invaders than between native and alien species, leading to an indirect facilitative effect. Alternatively, recent environmental changes (e.g., eutrophication, climate change) may have added new environmental filters. Determining how initial invasions might pave the road for subsequent invasions is crucial for effective multispecies management decisions and contributes a new aspect to our understanding of community assembly.","[Sheppard, Christine S.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Carboni, Marta; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Essl, Franz] Univ Vienna, Div Conservat Vegetat & Landscape Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Seebens, Hanno] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Frankfurt, Germany",University Hohenheim; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; University of Vienna; Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN),"Sheppard, CS (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany.",christine.sheppard@uni-hohenheim.de,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Essl, Franz/ABE-7064-2020; Seebens, Hanno/I-2310-2019; Sheppard, Christine S./ABB-3124-2021; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Essl, Franz/0000-0001-8253-2112; Seebens, Hanno/0000-0001-8993-6419; Sheppard, Christine S./0000-0002-7847-2310; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758","Austrian Science Fund [I2086-B16]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-EBID-0004]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SE 1891/2-1, SH 924/1-1]; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite,"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: I2086-B16; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR-13-EBID-0004; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: SE 1891/2-1 and SH 924/1-1; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",,72,17,17,6,81,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Using a global dataset composed of 5242 observations encompassing 48 agricultural pest species and 26 crop species, we tested the role of pest traits (exotic status, host breadth and habitat breadth) and environmental context (crop type, range in landscape gradient and climate) in modifying the pest response to increasing semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. For natives, increasing semi-natural habitats decreased the abundance of pests that exploit only crop habitats or that are highly polyphagous. On the contrary, populations of exotic pests increased with an increasing cover of semi-natural habitats. These effects might be related to changes in host plants and other resources across the landscapes and/or to modified top-down control by natural enemies. The range of the landscape gradient explored and climate did not affect pests, while crop type modified the response of pests to landscape composition. Although species traits and environmental context helped in explaining some of the variability in pest response to landscape composition, the observed large interspecific differences suggest that a portfolio of strategies must be considered and implemented for the effective control of rapidly changing communities of crop pests in agroecosystems.","[Tamburini, Giovanni] Univ Bari, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci DiSSPA, Bari, Italy; [Santoiemma, Giacomo; Marini, Lorenzo] Univ Padua, DAFNAE, Padua, Italy; [O'Rourke, Megan E.] Virginia Tech, Sch Plant & Environm Sci, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Bommarco, Riccardo] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Chaplin-Kramer, Rebecca] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Nat Capital Project, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dainese, Matteo] Eurac Res, Inst Alpine Environm, Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Karp, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Kim, Tania N.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Entomol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Martin, Emily A.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Geobot, Zool Biodivers, Hannover, Germany; [Petersen, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Dept Entomol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Padua; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Stanford University; European Academy of Bozen-Bolzano; University of California System; University of California Davis; Kansas State University; Leibniz University Hannover; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Tamburini, G (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Soil Plant & Food Sci DiSSPA, Bari, Italy.",giovanni.tamburini@uniba.it,"Marini, Lorenzo/B-1119-2009; Santoiemma, Giacomo/J-7169-2019; Martin, Emily A.

To date, only a few macroecological studies have examined adaptations of plant species to different levels of UV-B. Here, we combined herbarium specimens of Hieracium pilosella L. and Echium vulgare L. with a novel UV-B dataset to examine differences in leaf hair traits between the plants' native and alien ranges. We analysed scans of 336 herbarium specimens using standardized measurements of leaf area, hair density (both species) and hair length (H. pilosella only). While accounting for other bioclimatic variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation) and effects of herbivory, we examined whether UV-B exposure explains the variability and geographical distribution of these traits in the native (Northern Hemisphere) vs. the alien (Southern Hemisphere) range. UV-B explained the largest proportion of the variability and geographical distribution of hair length in H. pilosella (relative influence 67.1%), and hair density in E. vulgare (66.2%). Corresponding with higher UV-B, foliar hairs were 25% longer for H. pilosella and 25% denser for E. vulgare in records from the Southern as compared to those from the Northern Hemisphere. However, focusing on each hemisphere separately or controlling for its effect in a regression analysis, we found no apparent influence of UV-B radiation on hair traits. Thus, our findings did not confirm previous experimental studies which suggested that foliar hairs may respond to higher UV-B intensities, presumably offering protection against detrimental levels of radiation. We cannot rule out UV-B radiation as a possible driver because UV-B radiation was the only considered variable that differed substantially between the hemispheres, while bioclimatic conditions (e.g. temperature, precipitation) and other considered variables (herbivory damage, collection date) were at similar levels. However, given that either non-significant or inconclusive relationships were detected within hemispheres, alternative explanations of the differences in foliar hairs are more likely, including the effects of environment, genotypes or herbivory.","[Vaclavik, Tomas; Beckmann, Michael; Cord, Anna F.; Bindewald, Anja M.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Vaclavik, Tomas] Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Bindewald, Anja M.] Univ Appl Sci Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Palacky University Olomouc; Bremen University of Applied Sciences,"Vaclavik, T (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Leipzig, Germany.;Vaclavik, T (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",tomas.vaclavik@ufz.de,"Cord, Anna/AAE-8327-2022; VÁCLAVÍK, Tomáš/N-3163-2019; Vaclavik, Tomas/B-4668-2013","VÁCLAVÍK, Tomáš/0000-0002-1113-6320; Vaclavik, Tomas/0000-0002-1113-6320; Cord, Anna F./0000-0003-3183-8482; Beckmann, Michael/0000-0002-5678-265X","German National Academic Foundation; Global Assessment of Land Use Dynamics, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Ecosystem Services GLUES (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [01LL0901A]","German National Academic Foundation; Global Assessment of Land Use Dynamics, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Ecosystem Services GLUES (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)","The work was supported by the German National Academic Foundation that funded a research stay in New Zealand in order to collect the herbarium data and by grant 01LL0901A: Global Assessment of Land Use Dynamics, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Ecosystem Services GLUES (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research).

We investigated geographical variation in body size and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) of invasive bullfrogs in southwestern China, by sampling two breeding populations (descendants of a single source population) inhabiting sites at low (1,412 m, Shiping) and high (2,692 m, Luguhu) altitudes. Both populations exhibited significant SSD, with females larger than males. At high altitude, mean body size of both sexes and the degree of SSD were significantly reduced; the reduction in mean body size with increasing altitude was more pronounced in females, although not significantly so. Female bullfrogs also showed a significant decrease in average age at high altitude that may be a major factor related to this pattern; average age of male bullfrogs did not vary significantly with altitude. Growth rate of both sexes was also lower at high altitude. Our results provide the first evidence that introduced bullfrog's exhibit geographical variation in morphology in invaded areas in response to different environments, likely due to changes in climate. Additional research is required to determine the mechanism of this variation (i.e., physiological or developmental plasticity, mortality rate, selective pressure) and most importantly, to evaluate the potential for variation in the impacts of introduced bullfrogs on native ecosystems in China.","[Liu Xuan; Li Yiming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu Xuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [McGarrity, Monica] Univ Florida IFAS, Gulf Coast Res & Educ Ctr, Plant City, FL 33563 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Li, YM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, 1 Datun Beichen W Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liym@ioz.ac.cn,"LI, yi/HKO-0480-2023; Liu, Xuan/AAF-3703-2020","Liu, Xuan/0000-0003-1572-1268",973 program [2007CB411600]; National Science Foundation [30870312],973 program(National Basic Research Program of China); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Y.

Because biological invasions frequently involve the admixture of previously isolated lineages as a result of human-aided dispersal, studies of invasive populations can reveal how admixture results in novel genotypes and shifts in functional trait variation within populations. Further, because invasive species can be ecosystem engineers within invaded ecosystems, admixture-induced shifts in the functional traits of invaders can affect the composition of native biodiversity and alter the flow of resources through the system. Thus, invasions represent promising yet under-investigated examples of how the effects of short-term evolutionary changes can cascade across biological scales of diversity. Here, we propose a conceptual framework that admixture between divergent source populations during biological invasions can reorganize the genetic variation underlying key functional traits, leading to shifts in the mean and variance of functional traits within invasive populations. Changes in the mean or variance of key traits can initiate new ecological feedback mechanisms that result in a critical transition from a native ecosystem to a novel invasive ecosystem. We illustrate the application of this framework with reference to a well-studied plant model system in invasion biology and show how a combination of quantitative genetic experiments, functional trait studies, whole ecosystem field studies and modeling can be used to explore the dynamics predicted to trigger these critical transitions.","[Molofsky, Jane; Kaproth, Matthew A.] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Keller, Stephen R.] Univ Maryland, Appalachian Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Lavergne, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Kaproth, Matthew A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Eppinga, Maarten B.] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Dept Environm Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Vermont; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Utrecht University,"Molofsky, J (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",jane.molofsky@uvm.edu,"Keller, Stephen/J-6652-2013","Keller, Stephen/0000-0001-8887-9213","USDA Hatch; European Research Council [281422]; ANR [ANR-08-PEXT-03, ANR-08-PEXT-11]; National Science Foundation [IOS-1238885];  [USDA-NRI 2006-03645]",USDA Hatch(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ,"Funding provided by USDA Hatch and USDA-NRI 2006-03645 grant awarded to J.M., the European Research Council (project TEEMBIO, FP7/2007-2013 Grant Agreement no. 281422), and from ANR projects SCION (ANR-08-PEXT-03) and EVORANGE (ANR-08-PEXT-11) projects to S.L and support from National Science Foundation IOS-1238885 to S.R.K.",,74,14,14,0,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Terrestrial LL can be consumed by macroinvertebrates and microbes to fuel the detrital-based food webs in freshwaters. To date, our knowledge of LL decomposition in freshwaters is largely based on broadleaved LL, while the patterns and drivers of coniferous leaf-litter (CLL) decomposition in streams and rivers remain poorly understood. Here, we present a global investigation of CLL decomposition in streams and rivers by collecting data from 35 publications. We compared LL breakdown rates in this study with other global-scale studies (including conifers and broadleaved species), between evergreen and deciduous conifers, and between native and invasive conifers. We also investigated the climatic, geographic (latitude and altitude), stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors (e.g., mesh size and experimental duration) in influencing CLL decomposition. We found that the following: (1) LL breakdown rates in this study were 18.5-28.8 and 4.9-16.8% slower than those in other global-scale studies when expressed as per day and per degree day, respectively. Conifer LL in coarse mesh bags, for evergreen and invasive conifers, decomposed 13.6, 10.3, and 10.8% faster than in fine mesh bags, for deciduous and native conifers, respectively; (2) CLL traits, stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors explained higher variations in CLL decomposition than climatic and geographic factors; (3) CLL nutritional quality (N and P), water temperature, and experimental duration were better predictors of CLL decomposition than other predictors in categories of LL traits, stream physicochemical characteristics, and experimental factors, respectively; and (4) total and microbial-mediated CLL breakdown rates showed linear relationships with latitude, altitude, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation. Our results imply that the replacement of native forests by conifer plantation would impose great impacts on adjacent freshwaters by retarding the LL processing rate. Moreover, future climate warming which is very likely to happen in mid- and high-latitude areas according to the IPCC 6th report would accelerate LL decomposition, with a potential consequence of food depletion for detritivores in freshwaters during hot summers.","[Xiang, Hongyong; Yang, Haijun] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Li, Kun] Heilongjiang Univ, Heilongjiang Prov Key Lab Ecol Restorat & Resource, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Cao, Lina; Zhang, Zhenxing] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Vege, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenxing] Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Jilin Songnen Grassland Ecosyst Natl Observat & Re, Minist Educ, Changchun, Peoples R China",Yunnan University; Heilongjiang University; Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China,"Yang, HJ (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZX (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Vege, Changchun, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZX (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Jilin Songnen Grassland Ecosyst Natl Observat & Re, Minist Educ, Changchun, Peoples R China.",zhangzx725@nenu.edu.cn; yang@nenu.edu.cn,"李, 昆/J-7254-2019","李, 昆/0000-0002-6552-7036; Xiang, Hongyong/0000-0002-4730-180X","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M692728]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32101310, 32071587]; China Scholarship Council [202006625001]; Science Foundation of Science and Technology of Education Department of Jilin Province [JJKH20211293KJ]; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China [YQ2021C031]; Postdoctoral Scientific Research Developmental Fund of Heilongjiang Province [LBH-Q20166]; Basal Research Fund for Undergraduate Universities of Heilongjiang Province [2019-KYYWF-0598]",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Science Foundation of Science and Technology of Education Department of Jilin Province; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province); Postdoctoral Scientific Research Developmental Fund of Heilongjiang Province; Basal Research Fund for Undergraduate Universities of Heilongjiang Province,"This work was supported by the fellowship of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M692728), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32101310 and 32071587), the China Scholarship Council (202006625001), the Science Foundation of Science and Technology of Education Department of Jilin Province (JJKH20211293KJ), the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (YQ2021C031), the Postdoctoral Scientific Research Developmental Fund of Heilongjiang Province (LBH-Q20166), and the Basal Research Fund for Undergraduate Universities of Heilongjiang Province (2019-KYYWF-0598).",,85,0,0,10,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Light availability differs greatly depending on grassland density, and competition for light is an important component of species dynamics. In this study, we examined if light reduction is an effective method to suppress a native invader in pre-alpine meadows of low to moderate land-use intensity. Our study focused on the effects of shading and other site conditions on vegetative and generative growth of Jacobaea aquatica, a poisonous hemicryptophyte regionally spreading in C Europe. We hypothesized that negative shade effects occur in addition to suppression by high grassland productivity, moist climate and less intense management. Furthermore, we postulated that shading affects vegetative growth more than reproduction. To understand the effects of shading we conducted a greenhouse experiment with plants grown under different shading nets. These results were compared to data gathered from 20 field sites that represented a distinct gradient in grassland management and shading. Overall, performance of generative J. aquatica plants was reduced by shading in the greenhouse, while density of vegetative plants was reduced in the field. In the greenhouse, plants affected by shading had significantly fewer flower heads and slightly smaller rosettes. Under field conditions, shading effects occurred together with additional environmental factors, while density of vegetative plants was significantly reduced by shading. Our data show that while realising high shading effects in the field is hard to accomplish, light reduction still has an influence on plant performance and population density, and could therefore be used to suppress the invasive native J. aquatica. In low to moderate intensity grasslands, suppression can be achieved by delaying the first mowing, thus enhancing shading. We conclude that manipulating environmental filters to increase resource competition is recommended as an alternative management tool to control the abundance of invasive native plants in grassland.","[Krieger, Marie-Therese; Ditton, Julia; Albrecht, Harald; Linderl, Luise; Kollmann, Johannes; Teixeira, Leonardo H.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Restorat Ecol, TUM Sch Life Sci, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Kollmann, Johannes] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, As, Norway; [Krieger, Marie-Therese; Ditton, Julia] Tech Univ Munich, Restorat Ecol, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Technical University of Munich,"Krieger, MT; Ditton, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Restorat Ecol, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",marie-therese.krieger@tum.de; julia.ditton@tum.de; harald.albrecht@tum.de; johannes.kollmann@tum.de; leonardo.teixeira@tum.de,"Kollmann, Johannes/B-4255-2012; Teixeira, Leonardo H./ABP-6119-2022","Kollmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4990-3636; Teixeira, Leonardo H./0000-0001-7443-087X; Albrecht, Harald/0000-0002-6078-3014",StMELF [StMELF (A/17/05)]; LfU [5103184]; LUBW [5103184];  [A/17/05],StMELF; LfU; LUBW; ,This work was funded by StMELF (A/17/05) and LfU and LUBW (5103184) ; these entities had no role in the design or implementation of the experiments.,,65,1,1,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,1872-6992,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

We conducted a detailed study of potential mechanisms underlying an elevational gradient in mortality that has characterized recent population declines of a threatened alpine plant, the Haleakala silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum). We used a pair of greenhouse experiments staged at high and low elevations to test the influences of plasticity (to contrasting soil water availability and atmospheric conditions) and heredity (different seed source elevations) on the development of functional traits associated with drought resistance and on performance in a terminal drought. We then out-planted a subset of plants into three common-garden plots near the bottom, middle, and top of the silversword elevational range, and tracked growth and survival over 3.5 yr. A range of morphological traits (root and leaf mass fractions, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and root length per shoot mass) exhibited either heritable variation or plasticity or both. Among physiological traits measured, only water use efficiency exhibited a plastic treatment response. Survival of out-plants was influenced during the first year by a home site advantage, and by the water treatment imposed in the greenhouses, with high water plants dying more often than low water plants. These effects subsequently dissipated, being replaced over the final 1.5 yr by a strengthening out-plant site effect: survival was positively associated with site elevation, matching the pattern of mortality observed in the wild population. The balance of information suggests this pattern stems from lower elevation plants being less drought resistant than higher elevation plants, owing principally to plasticity, and thus suffering greater mortality during recent dry seasons. The pattern may be enhanced by stronger deviations from typical climatic conditions at lower elevations. Our findings suggest that future management should focus on climatically suitable habitat rather than advantageous genetic ecotypes. More broadly, they provide evidence that clinal variation can be important to consider when modeling future vegetation responses to climate change.","[Krushelnycky, Paul D.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Felts, Jesse M.; Brown, Matthew D.] Haleakala Natl Pk, Resources Management Div, Makawao, HI 96768 USA; [Robichaux, Robert H.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Barton, Kasey E.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Litton, Creighton M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Arizona; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Krushelnycky, PD (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",pauldk@hawaii.edu,,,"Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative; Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center; Haleakala National Park; Hau.oli Mau Loa Foundation; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai.i at Manoa via the USDA NIFA Hatch Program [HAW01127H]; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai.i at Manoa via McIntyre Stennis Program [HAW01123M]","Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative; Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center; Haleakala National Park; Hau.oli Mau Loa Foundation; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai.i at Manoa via the USDA NIFA Hatch Program; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai.i at Manoa via McIntyre Stennis Program","Funding and internship support for this research was provided by the Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative, the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center, Haleakala National Park, the Hau.oli Mau Loa Foundation, and the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai.i at Manoa via the USDA NIFA Hatch (HAW01127H) and McIntyre Stennis (HAW01123M) Programs.

Invasive species often undergo adaptive evolution, but whether invasive species show greater evolutionary potential than their native counterparts under climate change has rarely been evaluated. We conducted experimental evolution trials comparing the evolution of physiological performance (light-saturated photosynthetic rate, A(max)) of coexisting and closely related (1) invasive-native species pairs from Arid, Alpine, and Antarctic ecosystems, and (2) an invasive-naturalized species pair from a Mediterranean ecosystem differing in invasiveness. Experiments were conducted over three generations and under four environments of temperature and water availability resembling typical and climate change conditions in each ecosystem. A(max) increased across generations for most species. Invasive species from Arid, Alpine, and Antarctic ecosystems showed similar, greater, and lesser evolution of A(max) than their native counterparts, respectively. The Mediterranean invasive species showed greater evolution of A(max) than its naturalized congener. Similar patterns were observed in all four experimental environments for each ecosystem, suggesting that comparable responses may be expected under climate change scenarios.

Advances in conventional breeding and crop domestication have begun to mitigate this issue by increasing varieties and generation of stress-resistant traits. Yet, very few species of legumes have been domesticated and perceived as usable food/feed material, while various wild species remain unknown and underexploited despite the critical global food demand. Besides the existence of a few domesticated species, there is a bottleneck challenge of product acceptability by both farmers and consumers. Therefore, this paper explores farmers' perceptions, preferences, and the possible utilization of some wild Vigna species of legumes toward their domestication and exploitation. Quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted in a mid-altitude agro-ecological zone (Arusha region) and a high altitude agro-ecological zone (Kilimanjaro region) in Tanzania to obtain the opinions of 150 farmers regarding wild legumes and their uses. The study showed that very few farmers in the Arusha (28%) and Kilimanjaro (26%) regions were aware of wild legumes and their uses. The study further revealed through binary logistic regression analysis that the prior knowledge of wild legumes depended mainly on farmers' location and not on their gender, age groups, education level, or farming experience. From the experimental plot with 160 accessions of wild Vigna legumes planted and grown up to near complete maturity, 74 accessions of wild Vigna legumes attracted the interest of farmers who proposed various uses for each wild accession. A Chi(2) test (likelihood ratio test) revealed that the selection of preferred accessions depended on the farmers' gender, location, and farming experience. Based on their morphological characteristics (leaves, pods, seeds, and general appearance), farmers perceived wild Vigna legumes as potentially useful resources that need the attention of researchers. Specifically, wild Vigna legumes were perceived as human food, animal feed, medicinal plants, soil enrichment material, and soil erosion-preventing materials. Therefore, it is necessary for the scientific community to consider these lines of farmers' suggestions before carrying out further research on agronomic and nutritional characteristics toward the domestication of these alien species for human exploitation and decision settings.","[Harouna, Difo Voukang; Matemu, Athanasia O.] NM AIST, Dept Food Biotechnol & Nutr Sci, POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania; [Venkataramana, Pavithravani B.; Ndakidemi, Patrick Alois] NM AIST, Dept Sustainable Agr Biodivers & Ecosyst Manageme, POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania; [Harouna, Difo Voukang; Venkataramana, Pavithravani B.; Matemu, Athanasia O.; Ndakidemi, Patrick Alois] Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Res Agr Adv Teaching Excellence & Sustainabil, POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania",Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science & Technology,"Ndakidemi, PA (corresponding author), NM AIST, Dept Sustainable Agr Biodivers & Ecosyst Manageme, POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania.;Ndakidemi, PA (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela African Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Res Agr Adv Teaching Excellence & Sustainabil, POB 447, Arusha, Tanzania.",harounad@nm-aist.ac.tz; pavithravani.venkataramana@nm-aist.ac.tz; athanasia.matemu@nm-aist.ac.tz; patrick.ndakidemi@nm-aist.ac.tz,"Harouna, Difo Voukang/V-8691-2019; Matemu, Athanasia/GVW-2391-2022; Matemu, Athanasia Oswald/AGZ-8635-2022","Harouna, Difo Voukang/0000-0003-3342-6772; Matemu, Athanasia/0000-0001-8217-6349; Matemu, Athanasia Oswald/0000-0001-8217-6349","Centre for Research, Agricultural Advancement, Teaching Excellence and Sustainability in Food and Nutrition Security (CREATES-FNS) through the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) [P220/CAM.16]; International Foundation for Science (IFS) [I-3-B-6203-1]","Centre for Research, Agricultural Advancement, Teaching Excellence and Sustainability in Food and Nutrition Security (CREATES-FNS) through the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST); International Foundation for Science (IFS)(International Foundation for Science)","This research was partially funded by the Centre for Research, Agricultural Advancement, Teaching Excellence and Sustainability in Food and Nutrition Security (CREATES-FNS) through the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) under the reference number P220/CAM.16.

In order to characterize this particular ecological niche, which is out of reach for a direct investigation, environmental factors likely to influence the interaction between larvae and host plant roots were investigated using a simplified laboratory microcosm. Environmental light and oxygen concentrations appeared to be the main factors influencing larval attachment, a dark anoxic environment being significantly more favourable. Carbon dioxide produced by the root system of the host plant appeared to be an attractive cue for larval attachment. Knowledge of the hierarchy of these environmental factors may enable us to better understand the ecological traits of larval C. richiardii in deep water.

These species possess traits that ease their progression into alpine habitats, which could be a threat to rare and endemic plants in these areas. A prime example of this is in the Gaspesie National Park (Quebec) where many nonnative species, such as Poa annua, are progressing in elevation, establishing in alpine habitats inhabited by rare and endemic species. In the case of this study, the impacts of elevation on parental plants and date of collection on seed germinability was determined for mature seeds of P. annua on three mountains in the Gaspesie National Park. Elevation as well as the date of collection did not influence germination of seeds of P. annua, and total germination remained very high (>80%) at high elevations. Therefore, because seed germination is not affected by maternal plant elevation, we assume that the abundance of P. annua may increase in disturbed alpine areas, and management strategies should be developed to counter or mitigate the effects of these invasions.","[Deschenes, Elise; Caubel, Eloise; Sirois, Luc] Univ Quebec Rimouski, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite du Quebec a Rimouski,"Sirois, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",luc_sirois@uqar.ca,,"Deschenes, Elise/0000-0002-1910-7305",UQAR special research fund,UQAR special research fund,"We would like to thank Isabelle Glazer and Alany Blanchette for their help during the fieldwork, as well as Virginie Labrecque for her help during the germination tests.

Distributional records of those 57 taxa in Croatia from the Flora Croatica Database were used to analyse the occurrence of invasive plants among three biogeographical regions (Alpine, Continental and Mediterranean). Results and Conclusions: In total, 10 CSR types were found among the invasive plants of Croatia, mostly CR-strategists, followed by C-strategists and R-strategists. The largest proportion of R-strategists was found in the Mediterranean region, while the largest proportion of C-strategists was found in the Alpine region. Out of the three main strategies, competitive ability and ruderality were found to be frequently present within the Croatian invasive flora, while stress tolerance was almost absent.","[Vukovic, Nina; Jelaska, Sven D.] Univ Zagreb, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia; [Milovic, Milenko] Med & Chem Sch, HR-22000 Shibenik, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Jelaska, SD (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Marulicev Trg 20, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",sven.jelaska@biol.pmf.hr,"Jelaska, Sven D./F-2148-2011","Jelaska, Sven D./0000-0003-3834-002X; Vukovic, Nina/0000-0001-8149-0782","Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport [119-0000000-3169]","Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport(Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, Republic of Croatia)","This research was supported by the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sport (Grant No. 119-0000000-3169).

Given the differences in environmental tolerances among species, little is known about what factors determine the extent to which the observed size of the naturalized range of a species and hence the extent to which the observed richness of naturalized species of a region approach their full potential. Here, we asked which region- and species-specific characteristics explain differences between observed and expected naturalizations. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We determined the observed naturalized distribution outside Europe for 1,485 species endemic to Europe using the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database and their expected distributions outside Europe using species distribution models. First, we investigated which of seven socio-economic factors related to introduction pathways, anthropogenic pressures and inventory effort best explained the differences between observed and expected naturalized European floras. Second, we examined whether distributional features, economic use and functional traits explain the extent to which species have filled their expected ranges outside Europe. Results In terms of suitable area, more than 95% of expected naturalizations of European plants were not yet observed. Species were naturalized in only 4.2% of their suitable regions outside of Europe (range filling) and in 0.4% of their unsuitable regions (range expansion). Anthropogenic habitat disturbance primarily explained the difference between observed and expected naturalized European floras, as did the number of treaties relevant to invasive species. Species of ornamental and economic value and with large specific leaf area performed better at filling and expanding beyond their expected range. Main conclusions The naturalization of alien plant species is explained by climate matching but also by the regional level of human development, the introduction pressure associated with the ornamental and economic values of the species and their adaptation to disturbed environments.","[Pouteau, Robin; Bruner, Caroline; van Kleunen, Mark] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Pouteau, Robin] Univ Montpellier, INRAE, CNRS, CIRAD,IRD,AMAP, Montpellier, France; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine, LECA,CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Hobohm, Carsten] Univ Flensburg EUF, Ecol & Environm Educ Working Grp, Flensburg, Germany; [Conn, Barry J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dawson, Wayne] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England; [Dechoum, Michele de Sa] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Dechoum, Michele de Sa] Horus Inst Environm Conservat & Dev, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Ebel, Aleksandr L.] Tomsk State Univ, Dept Bot, Tomsk, Russia; [Ebel, Aleksandr L.; Zykova, Elena] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Siberian Bot Garden, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Essl, Franz; Lenzner, Bernd] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Macroecol Grp, Global Change,Bioinvas, Vienna, Austria; [Fragman-Sapir, Ori] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem Bot Gardens, Jerusalem, Israel; [Fristoe, Trevor; Yang, Qiang; van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, Constance, Germany; [Jogan, Nejc] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kreft, Holger; Weigelt, I.

Here, we focused on the early phases of ornamental plant invasion in order to identify which plant features and cultivation practices may favor the escape of ornamental plants from domestic gardens to abandoned agricultural land sites in the Mediterranean Region. We used an original approach which consisted in visiting 120 private gardens in an urbanizing rural area of the French Mediterranean backcountry, and then visited surrounding old fields to determine which planted species had escaped out of the gardens. We built a database of 407 perennial ornamental alien species (most of which were animal-dispersed), and determined nineteen features that depicted the strength of species' propagule pressure within gardens, the match between species requirements and local physical environment, and each species' reproductive characteristics. Using standard and phylogenetic logistic regression, we found that ornamental alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were planted in gardens' margins, if they had a preference for dry soil, were tolerant to high-pH or pH-indifferent, and if they showed a capacity for clonal growth. Focusing only on animal-dispersed plants, we found that alien plants were more likely to have escaped if they were abundant in gardens and showed preference for dry soil. This suggests that gardening practices have a primary impact on the probability of a species to escape from cultivation, along with species pre-adaptation to local soil conditions, and capacity of asexual reproduction. Our results may have important implications for the implementation of management practices and awareness campaigns in order to limit ornamental plants to becoming invasive species in Mediterranean landscapes.","[Marco, Audrey; Bertaudiere-Montes, Valerie] Univ Aix Marseille 1, UMR UP IRD 151, Lab Populat Environnement Dev, F-13331 Marseille 3, France; [Lavergne, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble 1, UMR CNRS 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Dutoit, Thierry] Univ Avignon, UMR CNRS IRD IMEP 6116, IUT, F-84911 Avignon 9, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Avignon Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Marco, A (corresponding author), Univ Aix Marseille 1, UMR UP IRD 151, Lab Populat Environnement Dev, Ctr St Charles Case 10,3 Pl Victor Hugo, F-13331 Marseille 3, France.",audrey.marco@laposte.net,"Dutoit, Thierry/AAB-7398-2019","Dutoit, Thierry/0000-0001-9461-9215; marco, audrey/0000-0003-1557-5854",Association for Development of Teaching and Research,Association for Development of Teaching and Research,"We are grateful to the municipality of Lauris for its contribution to this work and to Lauris' inhabitants for allowing us to visit and study their properties.

This paper addresses the hypotheses outlined in the preceding paper: 1) A whole-plant system of modal plant functional types (PFTs) based on a core set of functional traits can provide an improved alternative to PFTs and traits used so far in models of vegetation response to climate change; 2) Modal PFTs are more efficient indicators of vegetation response to climate change than individual traits; 3) Improved plant functional selection criteria can lead to improved parameters in Earth System and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. Present-day (1975 centred) plant-climate relationships were analyzed within a global climatic framework of 1327 (200 m(2)) sample sites covering all major biomes. Five regions were selected for their range of bioclimatic gradients (arctic-boreal; cool temperate-subtropical; humid equatorial; hot, cold deserts). Biophysical site data were recorded along gradient oriented transects (gradsects) using a standard protocol that included all vascular plant taxa and modal PFTs. Regression, ordination and species distribution modeling were used to assess plant-climate indicator values against ten bioclimatic variables including extremes of contemporary thermal, light (energy) and moisture availability and estimates for 'present' (1975) and year 2100 climate scenarios. Modal PFTs and individual traits were highly correlated in differing patterns with bioclimate in each of the five regions in both climate scenarios with PFTs being the best predictors. Each of the three hypotheses is supported by these results, indicating that preference should be given to modal assemblages rather than individual traits as response parameters in predictive vegetation models. The indicators identified here are but one element of the highly complex array of other factors that influence vegetation response to terrestrial environmental change such as resource use, species acclimation, invasive species and human population pressure.","[Gillison, Andrew N.] Ctr Biodivers Management, POB 120, Yungaburra, Qld 4884, Australia",,"Gillison, AN (corresponding author), Ctr Biodivers Management, POB 120, Yungaburra, Qld 4884, Australia.",andygillison@gmail.com,,,,,,,101,10,10,3,29,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0367-2530,1618-0585,,FLORA,Flora,MAY,2019,254,,,,SI,,31,58,,10.1016/j.flora.2019.04.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2019.04.001,,,28,Plant Sciences; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IB2OT,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000470109300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cushion plants are an important life form of alpine ecosystems and will likely play a critical role for the resilience of these habitats to climate change. We studied cushion size distribution and different measures of the compactness of cushions (biomass and rosette density, leaf area index) of the cushion plant, Androsace tapete along an elevational gradient from 4500 to 5200 m a. s. l. in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains of the central Tibetan Plateau. Cushion size distribution, total cover, and compactness of cushions varied substantially along the elevational gradient. At the driest site at low elevation we found the lowest total cushion cover, a particularly high proportion of very small cushions, and the most compact cushions (highest rosette and biomass densities, and leaf area index (LAI) per cushion). Our results indicate that in the semi-arid Tibetan Plateau water availability is the more important climate factor than temperature affecting cushion plant traits and morphology.","[He, Yongtao; Shi, Peili; Zhang, Xianzhou; Yan, Wei; Sun, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Lhasa Stn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kueffer, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol Plant Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Du, Mingyuan] Natl Inst Agroenvironm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences (NIAES) Japan","He, YT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Lhasa Stn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",heyt@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Peili, SHi/AAT-6450-2021; Du, Mingyuan/AAE-3019-2020; zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022; Kueffer, Christoph/H-6091-2013; Du, Mingyuan/O-9951-2018; Zhang, XZ/HJA-4189-2022","Du, Mingyuan/0000-0003-0373-1661; Kueffer, Christoph/0000-0001-6701-0703; Du, Mingyuan/0000-0003-0373-1661; shi, pei li/0000-0002-1120-0003","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30700080, 31070391]; National Key Projects for Basic Research of China [2010CB951704, 2010CB833501]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Projects for Basic Research of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"We would like to thank the editors and three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Although tropical forests are the largest ecosystem source of nitrous oxide (N2O), drivers of spatial patterns within forests are poorly resolved. Here, we show that local variation in canopy foliar N, mapped by remote-sensing image spectroscopy, correlates with patterns of soil N2O emission from a lowland tropical rainforest. We identified ten 0.25 ha plots (assemblages of 40-70 individual trees) in which average remotely-sensed canopy N fell above or below the regional mean. The plots were located on a single minimally-dissected terrace (<1 km(2)) where soil type, vegetation structure and climatic conditions were relatively constant. We measured N2O fluxes monthly for 1 yr and found that high canopy N species assemblages had on average three-fold higher total mean N2O fluxes than nearby lower canopy N areas. These differences are consistent with strong differences in litter stoichiometry, nitrification rates and soil nitrate concentrations. Canopy N status was also associated with microbial community characteristics: lower canopy N plots had two-fold greater soil fungal to bacterial ratios and a significantly lower abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, although genes associated with denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ) showed no relationship with N2O flux. Overall, landscape emissions from this ecosystem are at the lowest end of the spectrum reported for tropical forests, consist with multiple metrics indicating that these highly productive forests retain N tightly and have low plant-available losses. These data point to connections between canopy and soil processes that have largely been overlooked as a driver of denitrification. Defining relationships between remotely-sensed plant traits and soil processes offers the chance to map these processes at large scales, potentially increasing our ability to predict N2O emissions in heterogeneous landscapes.","[Soper, Fiona M.; Cleveland, Cory C.] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59808 USA; [Sullivan, Benjamin W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Nasto, Megan K.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Nasto, Megan K.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Osborne, Brooke B.; Porder, Stephen] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Bru, David; Philippot, Laurent] INRA, UMR Agroecol 1347, Dijon, France; [Balzotti, Christopher S.; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, 206 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Taylor, Phillip G.; Townsend, Alan R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Brown University; INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite de Bourgogne; Carnegie Institution for Science; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Soper, FM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59808 USA.",fiona.soper@umontana.edu,"Townsend, Alan/AAE-9602-2019; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Porder, Stephen/ACT-2074-2022; Philippot, Laurent/G-5598-2011","Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Philippot, Laurent/0000-0003-3461-4492; Soper, Fiona/0000-0002-9910-9377; Cleveland, Cory/0000-0002-8804-4248; Bru, David/0000-0002-1011-017X",National Science Foundation [1264031]; Carnegie Institution for Science; Avatar Alliance Foundation; Margaret A.

However, researchers and managers are concerned because climate warming has led to increased fire activity in recent decades. More area burned will result in larger land areas in early successional stages and will potentially limit tree establishment; therefore, evaluating long-term forest understory response to fire is important. We evaluate the impact of burn severity, overstory canopy cover, topography, and climate on understory plant community diversity and composition in seven wildfires, 9 to 12 years post fire, along a broad climate gradient from dry to moist mixed conifer forests in Idaho, Montana, and Washington, USA. Results: Climate was the most important driver for species diversity and composition, but a burn severity gradient was detectable in the species data one decade post fire. A strong overlap in species composition between burn severity levels was documented, but dispersion was lower for high burn severity sites, indicating that those sites are still recovering. Local species richness and diversity had a nonlinear relationship with the burn severity index dNBR, with a maximum at low to moderate burn severity; the relationship was stronger in moist climates. Functional trait analysis revealed higher grass and forb cover in high-severity burns, higher cover of tree seedlings, residual and off-site colonizers in burned areas, and more shade-tolerant species in unburned areas. Of the 270 species recorded, 10% were introduced; however, only three were of noxious status and two were invasive annual grasses, generally occurring on dry sites. Conclusions: The understory plant community was not fundamentally altered by these fires and fire contributed to increased species diversity both locally and regionally, suggesting that low to moderate burn severity fire is a treatment that contributes to long-term maintenance of a diverse and productive understory. Individual species traits were significant drivers of understory species assemblages and, as future change in climate and fire regimes leads to shifts in species composition, anticipation of consequences will be important. Although invasive species occurred at low cover levels, noxious weeds and invasive annual grasses will continue to be management challenges, particularly in dry regions of mixed conifer forests.","[Strand, Eva K.; Satterberg, Kevin L.; Smith, Alistair M.

Pinus flexilis E. James (limber pine) is a keystone five-needle pine species in mountain-top ecosystems of North America. White pine blister rust (WPBR), caused by a non-native fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola (J.C. Fisch.), has resulted in mortality in this conifer species and is still spreading through the distribution. The objective of this research was to develop P. flexilis transcriptome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using RNA-seq analysis for genetic mapping of the major gene (Cr4) that confers complete resistance to C. ribicola. Results: Needle tissues of one resistant and two susceptible seedling families were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. In silico SNP markers were uncovered by mapping the RNA-seq reads back to the de novo assembled transcriptomes. A total of 110,573 in silico SNPs and 2,870 indels were identified with an average of 3.7 SNPs per Kb. These SNPs were distributed in 17,041 unigenes. Of these polymorphic P. flexilis unigenes, 6,584 were highly conserved as compared to the genome sequence of P. taeda L (loblolly pine). High-throughput genotyping arrays were designed and were used to search for Cr4-linked genic SNPs in megagametophyte populations of four maternal trees by haploid-segregation analysis. A total of 32 SNP markers in 25 genes were localized on the Cr4 linkage group (LG). Syntenic relationships of this Cr4 LG map with the model conifer species P. taeda anchored Cr4 on Pinus consensus LG8, indicating that R genes against C. ribicola have evolved independently in different five-needle pines. Functional genes close to Cr4 were annotated and their potential roles in Cr4-mediated resistance were further discussed. Conclusions: We demonstrated a very effective, low-cost strategy for developing a SNP genetic map of a phenotypic trait of interest. SNP discovery through transcriptome comparison was integrated with high-throughput genotyping of a small set of in silico SNPs. This strategy may be applied to mapping any trait in non-model plant species that have complex genomes. Whole transcriptome sequencing provides a powerful tool for SNP discovery in conifers and other species with complex genomes, for which sequencing and annotation of complex genomes is still challenging. The genic SNP map for the consensus Cr4-LG may help future molecular breeding efforts by enabling both Cr4 positional characterization and selection of this gene against WPBR.","[Liu, Jun-Jun; Sturrock, Rona N.; Zamany, Arezoo; Williams, Holly; Ha, Amanda; Chan, Danelle] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada; [Schoettle, Anna W.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 240 West Prospect Rd, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Sniezko, Richard A.; Danchok, Bob; Savin, Douglas P.; Kegley, Angelia] US Forest Serv, USDA, Dorena Genet Resource Ctr, 34963 Shoreview Rd, Cottage Grove, OR 97424 USA",Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Liu, JJ (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Pacific Forestry Ctr, 506 West Burnside Rd, Victoria, BC V8Z 1M5, Canada.",jun-jun.liu@canada.ca; aschoettle@fs.fed.us,"Liu, Jun-Jun/T-4300-2019","Liu, Jun-Jun/0000-0002-9745-8258",US-FS Special Technology Development Program [R2-2014-01]; CFS-GRDI fund,US-FS Special Technology Development Program; CFS-GRDI fund(Natural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service),"We would like to thank Gary Zhang, Hao Chen, and Aimin Guan for help on bioinformatic analyses.

We investigated here key functional attributes of arable weeds compared to non-weed plants, at large spatial scale. Methods We used an intensive survey of plant communities in cultivated and non-cultivated habitats to define a pool of plants occurring in arable fields (weeds) and one of plants occurring only in open non-arable habitats (non-weeds) in France. We compared the two pools based on nine functional traits and three functional spaces (LHS, reproductive and resource requirement hypervolumes). Within the weed pool, we quantified the trait variation of weeds along a continuum of specialization to arable fields. Key Results Weeds were mostly therophytes and had higher specific leaf area, earlier and longer flowering, and higher affinity for nutrient-rich, sunny and dry environments compared to non-weeds, although functional spaces of weeds and non-weeds largely overlapped. When fidelity to arable fields increased, the spectrum of weed ecological strategies decreased as did the overlap with non-weeds, especially for the resource requirement hypervolume. Conclusions Arable weeds constitute a delimited pool defined by a trait syndrome providing tolerance to the ecological filters of arable fields (notably, regular soil disturbances and fertilization). The identification of such a syndrome is of great interest to predict the weedy potential of newly established alien plants. An important reservoir of plants may also become weeds after changes in agricultural practices, considering the large overlap between weeds and non-weeds.","[Bourgeois, Berenger] Fdn Rech Biodiversite, Ctr Synth & Anal Biodiversite, F-13100 Aix En Provence, France; [Bourgeois, Berenger; Mahaut, Lucie; Gaba, Sabrina] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Bourgeois, Berenger] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, LTSER Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38058 Grenoble, France; [Fried, Guillaume] Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Armengot, Laura] FiBL, Res Inst Organ Agr, CH-5070 Frick, Switzerland; [Denelle, Pierre; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery, EPHE, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,UMR 5175 CNRS, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Storkey, Jonathan] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Agr Sci, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Gaba, Sabrina] INRA, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, USC 1339, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Gaba, Sabrina] CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Gaba, Sabrina] Univ La Rochelle, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France","INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; Universite de Bourgogne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement du Travail (ANSES); Laboratoire de la Sante des Vegetaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); La Rochelle Universite","Bourgeois, B (corresponding author), Fdn Rech Biodiversite, Ctr Synth & Anal Biodiversite, F-13100 Aix En Provence, France.;Bourgeois, B (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France.;Bourgeois, B (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, LTSER Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",berengerbourgeois@gmail.com,"Bourgeois, Bérenger/S-2485-2019; Gaba, Sabrina/H-5240-2018; Armengot, Laura/K-8209-2017; Bourgeois, Bérenger/S-2493-2019; Fried, Guillaume/B-4777-2015; Munoz, Francois/C-4239-2015","Bourgeois, Bérenger/0000-0002-2885-2518; Gaba, Sabrina/0000-0002-7145-6713; Armengot, Laura/0000-0002-9820-9667; Bourgeois, Bérenger/0000-0002-2885-2518; Fried, Guillaume/0000-0002-3653-195X; Munoz, Francois/0000-0001-8776-4705; Mahaut, Lucie/0000-0002-5825-3807",CESAB-FRB as part of the activities of the DISCO-WEED Working Group; research programme LTS-M ASSIST - Achieving Sustainable Agricultural Systems - NERC [NE/N018125/1]; BBSRC [BBS/E/C/000I0120]; ANR [ANR-13-AGRO-286 0001]; ERANET Ecodeal project [FP7 ERA-NET 691 BiodivERsA/FACCE-JPI]; LISEA Project; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]; NERC [NE/N018125/1] Funding Source: UKRI,CESAB-FRB as part of the activities of the DISCO-WEED Working Group; research programme LTS-M ASSIST - Achieving Sustainable Agricultural Systems - NERC; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ERANET Ecodeal project; LISEA Project; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This paper was produced with the support of CESAB-FRB as part of the activities of the DISCO-WEED Working Group.

The identification of indicator or diagnostic species is usually performed by summarizing the species abundances within each group of sites. Species with high concentration in a given group of sites are considered diagnostic of that particular group. Among the methods proposed for the determination of indicator species, only very few have considered the species functional traits. This is quite surprising, as species influence ecosystem processes via their traits. Therefore, the species functional traits should give a much better ecological characterization of a group of sites than the species abundances. The aim of this paper is thus to use the species functional characteristics to improve their diagnostic value. These characteristics include the species functional traits and all species-level indicators of environmental association. The proposed method consists of combining the species abundances and their functional characteristics into a single composite index, which can be interpreted as the species fuzzy degree of compatibility with each group of sites. The interpretation of this index in terms of fuzzy set theory allows to introduce a high degree of flexibility in the computation of the species diagnostic values. To show the behavior of the proposed index, two worked examples with data on Alpine vegetation in northern Italy and urban alien species in the city of Brussels (Belgium) are used.","[Ricotta, Carlo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Environm Biol, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Acosta, Alicia T.

As J. aquatica mainly occurs in species-rich wet grasslands, our aim was to define management measures that do not reduce the conservation value of the resident communities. Location Data were collected from 20 independent sites which varied in productivity and management intensity across the pre-alpine Allgau region (South Germany). Methods We monitored effects of temporary abandonment and decreased mowing intensity in very low- and low-productive sites, as well as of decreased mowing and fertilization at moderately productive sites. Abundances of J. aquatica and the co-occurring species were recorded at start and end of two experiments (2018-2021: very low- and low-productive conservation grasslands; 2017-2020: moderately productive agricultural grasslands), while functional traits data of all species were gathered from the literature and specific databases. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) were used to analyse the effects of management intensity on the abundance of J. aquatica, functional diversity and species richness of the resident communities. Results At all productivity levels, the abundance of J. aquatica declined under reduced management. Changes in community composition and species richness of the resident community were less pronounced than the reduction of J. aquatica, but species richness declined under lowest management intensities. Thus, moderate reduction in management intensity provided the most benefits in terms of reduction of J. aquatica, and maintenance of species richness and composition of the resident plant community. Conclusions Reducing management intensity in wet grasslands decreases the abundance of J. aquatica and thus is a suitable method to control this species. As plant community responses were only partially consistent, management plans must account for the productivity of invaded sites. To avoid negative effects on grassland biodiversity, only moderate suppression of J. aquatica is recommended.","[Krieger, Marie-Therese; Ditton, Julia; Albrecht, Harald; Baaij, Barteline Martina; Kollmann, Johannes; Teixeira, Leonardo Henrique] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Chair Restorat Ecol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Baaij, Barteline Martina] Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kollmann, Johannes] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, As, Norway",Technical University of Munich; Wageningen University & Research; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"Krieger, MT (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Chair Restorat Ecol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",marie-therese.krieger@tum.de,"Kollmann, Johannes/B-4255-2012","Kollmann, Johannes/0000-0002-4990-3636; Albrecht, Harald/0000-0002-6078-3014","Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umwelt, Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg [5103184]; Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Ernahrung [A/17/05]","Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umwelt, Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg; Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Ernahrung","The study was funded by Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umwelt, Landesanstalt fur Umwelt Baden-Wurttemberg (5103184; Marie-Therese Krieger) and Bayerisches Staatsministerium fur Ernahrung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten (A/17/05; Julia Ditton).",,79,0,0,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1402-2001,1654-109X,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

However, the constraints imposed by the invaders on native organisms and their associated response, remain poorly understood. Native species can survive invasion through multiple resistance strategies (avoidance, tolerance, or escape), but the relative importance of each strategy and how they vary among functional groups have been little explored. In this study, we examined the resistance strategies of native forbs and graminoids facing invasion by Solidago canadensis. First, we characterized the general impacts of invader density on native plant biomass production and diversity. Then, we investigated specific constraints linked to the invasion (competition for light, nutrients and mycorrhizal fungi), and the associated resistance strategies of native species. S. canadensis had different negative impacts on native vegetation biomass production and diversity-depending on functional groups-due to increased competition for light, nutrients, and mycorrhizal interactions. The increased competition for light was partially (1) avoided (tall forbs and graminoids) or (2) tolerated (small, shade-resistant graminoids). The effects of (3) allelopathic compounds and (4) increased competition for nutrients were avoided by some forbs (high mycorrhizal infection rates). Finally, some forbs and graminoids (5) escaped all constraints by completing their cycle early in the season. Our results highlight the diversity of non-exclusive strategies (avoidance, tolerance, escape) by which different functional groups can respond to invasion-induced constraints. They suggest that to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying invasion, the native community responses should be decomposed into strategies specific to functional groups.","[Grange, Marie Charlotte; Munoz, Francois; Varona-Y-Varona, Sylvain; Renaud, Julien; Colace, Marie-Pascale; Gueguen, Maya; Arnoldi, Cindy; Bernard, Lionel; Gallien, Laure] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR CNRS 5553, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Interdisciplinaire Phys, UMR CNRS 5588, F-38041 Grenoble, France; [Moretti, Marco] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Grange, MC (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR CNRS 5553, F-38041 Grenoble, France.",mariegrange.p@gmail.com,"; Munoz, Francois/C-4239-2015","Gueguen, Maya/0000-0002-1045-2997; Munoz, Francois/0000-0001-8776-4705","2017-2018 Belmont Forum and BiodivERsA joint call for research proposals, under the BiodivScen ERA-Net COFUND programme; French National Research Agency; DIPEE Gre-noble-Chambery and the FREE-Alpes Federation [ANR-18-EBI4-0001-06, ANR-15-IDEX-02]; CNRS-INEE [2001-CNRS]; PEPS ECOMOB 2019 program","2017-2018 Belmont Forum and BiodivERsA joint call for research proposals, under the BiodivScen ERA-Net COFUND programme; French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)); DIPEE Gre-noble-Chambery and the FREE-Alpes Federation; CNRS-INEE; PEPS ECOMOB 2019 program","This research was funded through: the 2017-2018 Belmont Forum and BiodivERsA joint call for research pro-posals, under the BiodivScen ERA-Net COFUND programme, and with the funding organization: the French National Research Agency (ANR-18-EBI4-0001-06); the French National Research Agency in the framework of the Investisse-ments d'avenir program (ANR-15-IDEX-02); the DIPEE Gre-noble-Chambery and the FREE-Alpes Federation (FR n degrees 2001-CNRS); and the CNRS-INEE with the PEPS ECOMOB 2019 program.

Few attempts have been made to simultaneously address the importance of those processes in plant invasion. The present study uses the well-documented invasion history of Senecio inaequidens (Asteraceae) in southern France, where it was introduced at a single wool-processing site. It gradually invaded the Mediterranean coast and the Pyrenean Mountains, which have noticeably different climates. We used seeds from Pyrenean and Mediterranean populations, as well as populations from the first introduction area, to explore the phenotypic variation related to climatic variation. A reciprocal sowing experiment was performed with gardens under Mediterranean and Pyrenean climates. We analyzed climatic phenotypic variation in germination, growth, reproduction, leaf physiology and survival. Genetic structure in the studied invasion area was characterized using AFLP. We found consistent genetic differentiation in growth traits but no home-site advantage, so weak support for LA to climate. In contrast, genetic differentiation showed a relationship with colonization history. PP in response to climate was observed for most traits, and it played an important role in leaf trait variation. EME mediated by seed mass influenced all but leaf traits in a Pyrenean climate. Heavier, earlier-germinating seeds produced larger individuals that produced more flower heads throughout the growing season. However, in the Mediterranean garden, seed mass only influenced the germination rate. The results show that phenotypic variation in response to climate depends on various ecological and evolutionary processes associated with geographical zone and life history traits. Seeing the relative importance of EME and GD, we argue that a local adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity approach is therefore not sufficient to fully understand what shapes phenotypic variation and genetic architecture of invasive populations.","[Monty, Arnaud; Bizoux, Jean-Philippe; Mahy, Gregory] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Escarre, Jose] Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-5000 Montpellier, France",University of Liege; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Monty, A (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Biodivers & Landscape Unit, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",arnaud.monty@ulg.ac.be,,"mahy, gregory/0000-0003-3094-8620; Monty, Arnaud/0000-0003-1910-6748",Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique [FRFC 2.4605.06]; Belgian FONDS NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (FNRS) [FRFC 2.4556.05],Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Belgian FONDS NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"This research was supported by the project FRFC 2.4605.06 from the Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (www1.frs-fnrs.be).

A previous study showed that the suppression of flower-bud formation at high temperature in Taraxacum officinale decreases genetically with latitude from north to south in Japan. The present study investigated whether similar trait variation occurs among populations of native Taraxacum species in Japan. Seedlings of T. albidum (a low- and mid-latitude allopolyploid), T. japonicum (a mid-latitude diploid) and T. venustum (a high-latitude autopolyploid) were grown at three temperatures. Time to flower-bud appearance increased with temperature in T. japonicum and T. venustum, but did not increase in T. albidum. Time to flower-bud appearance did not differ significantly among the three species at 14 degrees C, but it was shorter in T. albidum than in the other two species at 19 degrees C and 24 degrees C. The early appearance of buds of T. albidum was confirmed by another experiment in which plants of 18 populations from the three species and T. platycarpum (a mid-latitude diploid) grown at 19 degrees C were used. The results clearly indicate that high-temperature suppression of flower-bud formation was lower in low-latitude species than in high-latitude species. This interspecific variation is analogous to the intraspecific variation in T. officinale. Time to bud appearance of five populations in T. albidum was homogeneous within and between the populations. The results suggest that the five populations are monoclonal and lack the sensitivity of suppression of flower-bud formation to high temperature.","[Yoshie, Fumio] Senshu Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan",,"Yoshie, F (corresponding author), Senshu Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.",yoshie@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0913-557X,1442-1984,,PLANT SPEC BIOL,Plant Spec.

We present the first study on the reproductive biology of Stellera chamaejasme, a toxic perennial weed which is abundant in the alpine meadows on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China since the 1960s. S. chamaejasme has synchronogamy and herkogamous flowers, which last for about 11 days. Flowers can be yellow, white or reddish. Our results suggest that this species is self-incompatible and depends entirely on pollen vectors for seed production. All the pollinators observed were Lepidopteran species; however, the pollinator assemblage was significantly different among populations and likely independent on floral colour. Reproductive success and invasion of the weed might be a complex function of floral traits, breeding system and pollination ecology. Generally, plants with generalized pollination system are more invasive. However, our results suggest that specialized flowers and self-incompatibility in the present case may not prevent invasion of the weed.

Predation can have a stronger effect on prey composition, biomass and taxonomic diversity in tropical regions compared to higher latitudes. Whether predation also shapes patterns of functional diversity and structure of prey communities, however, has rarely been explored across a latitudinal gradient. History of co-occurrence between predators and prey may also shape the outcome of the interaction, and increased novelty of introduced prey may lead to stronger trait responses. We investigated the influence of predation on trait responses of prey communities across 12 sites in four regions, from the sub-arctic to the tropics, using a field experiment in invaded coastal habitats. Prey communities experienced ambient or reduced predation pressure during assembly, and the effect of predation on functional diversity and structure of whole communities as well as their native and introduced components was assessed. Overall, predation increased functional diversity in the tropics, but effects were evident for introduced species only. Predation also shaped functional structure of low-latitude communities, but effects were strongest for native species in subtropical Mexico and introduced species in tropical Panama. Key traits driving shifts in functional structure were related to palatability and reproduction. In the tropics, the strong predation present under ambient conditions reduced the abundance of palatable traits in introduced prey relative to low-predation treatments, while in the subtropics, ambient predation increased the abundance of palatable traits in native prey. Reproductive traits that require high parental or energetic investment were favoured in low-predation treatments at both low-latitude regions. In summary, predation had a stronger influence on trait responses of prey communities at lower latitudes where biotic interactions are expected to be more intense, but changes in functional diversity and structure hinged on co-occurrence histories of local predators with native or introduced prey. This study provides one of the first examinations of the effects of predation on functional trait responses of prey communities across a latitudinal gradient.","[Lopez, Diana P.; Freestone, Amy L.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Freestone, Amy L.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD USA; [Freestone, Amy L.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Lopez, DP (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",dlopez@temple.edu,,"Lopez, Diana Paola/0000-0003-4317-6244; Freestone, Amy/0000-0002-4899-6682",United States National Science Foundation [OCE 1434528]; Temple University,United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Temple University,"United States National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: OCE 1434528; Temple University",,83,7,7,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Information regarding pollination and reproduction is urgent for threatened ecosystems, such as tropical montane ecosystems. In tropical mountains, pollination patterns are expected to conform to the reproductive assurance theory (due to low pollinator activity) and old, climatically buffered and infertile landscapes (OCBIL) theory (due to restricted plant range size). For 82 plant species of the Itatiaia National Park (including endemic and endangered species), we evaluated at least one of the following features: pollinator identity, flower color and size, flowering phenology, and pollinator dependence. Most plant species (ca. 60%) were pollinated by two or more functional groups of pollinators (generalized pollination), with high importance of flies as pollinators. There was low pollinator activity overall (less than one visit per flower per hour). Notably, the invasive honeybee Apis mellifera L. performed half of the visits to this entire plant community, suggesting an impact on the native pollinator fauna and consequently on the native flora. Most endemic plants were generalized with white and small flowers, while endangered species were pollination-specialized with colorful and large flowers. Thus, endangered species are susceptible to changes in pollinator fauna. Flowering seasonality reflected the importance of climatic constraints in this environment. One-third of the plant species were autogamous. Our data suggest that pollinator scarcity may have promoted reproductive assurance strategies such as generalization and pollinator independence. Our community-level study highlighted consistent pollination patterns for tropical mountains and emphasized threats for specialized endangered species.","[Bergamo, Pedro Joaquim] Inst Pesquisas Jardim Botanico Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Streher, Nathalia Susin; Zambon, Vivian] Univ Estadual Campinas, Programa Posgrad Biol Vegetal, Campinas, Brazil; [Wolowski, Marina] Univ Fed Alfenas, Inst Ciencias Natureza, Minas Gerais, Brazil; [Sazima, Marlies] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Campinas, Brazil",Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Federal de Alfenas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Bergamo, PJ (corresponding author), Inst Pesquisas Jardim Botanico Rio De Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",pjbergamo@gmail.com,,,"FAPESP [2016/06434-0]; CAPES [001]; CNPq [302781/2016-1, 157687/2019-8, 436335/2018-2]",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),PJB was funded by FAPESP during the data collection (Process n degrees 2016/06434-0).

Most such studies deal with dry, acidic, wet or alpine grassland types, while little is known about changes in mesic grasslands, particularly in urban areas. To investigate the effects of anthmpogenic environmental change on such grasslands, we resurveyed a selection of plots in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) approximately 25 years after their original recording. First, we checked whether 241 extensively used mesic grasslands (belonging to the Arrhenathereialia elatioris) in the city were still grasslands, and whether their management had changed. Then we resurveyed a representative subset of 30 quasi-permanent plots of 50 m(2). We tested whether biodiversity metrics, mean ecological indicator values, community weighted means (CWMs) of functional traits or the presence of individual vascular plant species had changed. We found that 15% of the original grasslands had been lost due to changes in land use during this period. Of the remaining grasslands, most of the former meadows were still mown, while many of the former pastures had been transformed into meadows. Measures of alpha diversity had not changed significantly for the 30 plots. However, species composition now indicated nutrient poorer. less base-rich and less ruderal site conditions, while CWMs of specific leaf area (SLA) had decreased and that of seed mass increased. In stands that were managed by mowing in both periods there was practically no change, while there was a pronounced change in those that had been transformed from grazing to mowing. In general, five species showed a significant increase and 16 species a significant decrease in frequency, with no obvious ecological difference between winners and losers. Alien species were rare in both periods and showed hardly any trend, except Veronica persica, which became rarer. In conclusion, more extensively used grasslands have survived to date than would be anticipated in such a rapidly growing city as Zurich. Their quality has hardly changed during the past quarter century, and if changes occurred, they are rather attributable to the intentional change of management from grazing to mowing. The relatively good ecological state of these urban grasslands might be due to a lower agricultural land use pressure than outside urban areas, as well as a constant management of many of these grasslands with a conservation focus. By maintaining these grasslands in their current state, they may have the potential to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in urban areas.","[Kummli, Julia] Nee Julia Banninger, Phonixweg 4, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kummli, Julia; Widmer, Stefan; Dengler, Juergen; Billeter, Regula] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Inst Nat Resource Sci IUNR, Vegetat Ecol, Gruentalstr 14, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Wilhelm, Markus] Univ Teacher Educ Lucerne, Inst Educ Sci & Social Studies, Sentimatt 1, CH-6003 Luzern, Switzerland; [Dengler, Juergen] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Plant Ecol, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Dengler, Juergen] Gennan Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv Halle Jena, Puschstr 4, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; University of Bayreuth,"Billeter, R (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Inst Nat Resource Sci IUNR, Vegetat Ecol, Gruentalstr 14, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.",regula.billeter@zhaw.ch,"Dengler, Jürgen/B-6604-2008","Dengler, Jürgen/0000-0003-3221-660X",,,,,72,4,4,4,5,FLORISTISCH-SOZIOLOGISCHEN ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT E V,GOETTINGEN,"WILHELM-WEBER-STRASSE 2, GOETTINGEN, 00000, GERMANY",0722-494X,,,TUEXENIA,Tuexenia,,2021,,41,,,,,423,+,,10.14471/2021.41.018,http://dx.doi.org/10.14471/2021.41.018,,,21,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,WQ2KR,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000713649600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the effects of a changing climate on the spread of naturalized ornamentals have not been evaluated by spatially and temporarily explicit range modelling at larger scales so far. Here, we assess how climate change and the frequency of cultivation interactively determine the spread of 15 ornamental plants over the 21st century in Europe. We coupled species distribution modelling with simulations of demography and dispersal to predict range dynamics of these species in annual steps across a 250 x 250 m raster of the study area. Models were run under four scenarios of climate warming and six levels of cultivation intensity. Cultivation frequency was implemented as size of the area used for planting a species. Although the area climatically suitable to the 15 species increases, on average, the area predicted to be occupied by them in 2090 shrinks under two of the three climate change scenarios. This contradiction obviously arises from dispersal limitations that were pronounced although we assumed that cultivation is spatially adapting to the changing climate. Cultivation frequency had a much stronger effect on species spread than climate change, and this effect was non-linear. The area occupied increased sharply from low to moderate levels of cultivation intensity, but levelled off afterwards. Our simulations suggest that climate warming will not necessarily foster the spread of alien garden plants in Europe over the next decades. However, climatically suitable areas do increase and hence an invasion debt is likely accumulating. Restricting cultivation of species can be effective in preventing species spread, irrespective of how the climate develops. However, for being successful, they depend on high levels of compliance to keep propagule pressure at a low level.","[Klonner, E.

Focusing on highly invaded riparian habitats we asked: (1) how do propagule pressure, resource availability and resident vegetation influence the success of the invasive Asian vine Humulus japonicus at different stages of its life cycle (i.e. seedling, vegetative and flowering) (2) what is the influence of increasing resource availability on the performance and trait plasticity of H. japonicus compared to a functionally similar co-occurring native species? To answer the first question we performed a repeated field survey along the Gardon River (S France) with detailed measurements of distance to the riverbed, soil characteristics, light availability, and resident vegetation cover. To answer the second question we used a greenhouse experiment to compare the biomass and three functional traits of H. japonicus and Galium aparine along a gradient of increasing water and nitrogen availability. Initial germination success was only determined by abiotic constraints, while the role of biotic resistance increased for later stages with establishment success favoured by the interaction of low resident vegetation cover and high soil fertility, and final integrated success favoured by high light availability. H. japonicus performed better and showed higher plasticity in plant height than G. aparine under increased resource availability while their biomass did not differ in the lower part of the resource gradient. Our study demonstrates that by combining field and experimental studies and analysing responses at different life stages we can gain a more complete understanding of how ecological filters shape successful invasions in the course of the life cycle.","[Fried, Guillaume; Mahaut, Lucie; Pinston, Amandine] Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, 755 Ave Campus Agropolis, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Mahaut, Lucie] Univ Montpellier, Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Pinston, Amandine] Univ Bourgogne, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Carboni, Marta] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement du Travail (ANSES); Laboratoire de la Sante des Vegetaux; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Bourgogne; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie","Fried, G (corresponding author), Anses, Lab Sante Vegetaux, Unite Entomol & Plantes Invas, 755 Ave Campus Agropolis, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France.",guillaume.fried@anses.fr,"Fried, Guillaume/B-4777-2015; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012","Fried, Guillaume/0000-0002-3653-195X; Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758",Syndicat Mixte d'Amenagement et de Gestion Equilibree (SMAGE) des Gardons,Syndicat Mixte d'Amenagement et de Gestion Equilibree (SMAGE) des Gardons,"We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for useful comments improving a previous version of the manuscript, Jean-Philippe Reygrobellet and the Syndicat Mixte d'Amenagement et de Gestion Equilibree (SMAGE) des Gardons which funded the study and the two MSc grants of AM in 2013 and LM in 2014.

However, whether rapid adaptation of introduced species can be driven by punctual changes in genome organization has received little attention. In plants, variation in genome size, i.e. variation in the amount of DNA per monoploid set of chromosomes through loss or gain of repeated DNA sequences, is known to influence a number of physiological, phenological and life-history features. The present study investigated whether change in genome size has contributed to the evolution of greater potential of vegetative growth in invasive populations of an introduced grass. The study was based on the recent demonstration that invasive genotypes of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) occurring in North America have emerged from recombination between introduced European strains. The genome sizes of more than 200 invasive and native genotypes were measured and their genome size was related to their phenotypic traits measured in a common glasshouse environment. Population genetics data were used to infer phylogeographical relationships between study populations, and the evolutionary history of genome size within the study species was inferred. Invasive genotypes had a smaller genome than European native genotypes from which they are derived. This smaller genome size had phenotypic effects that increased the species' invasive potential, including a higher early growth rate, due to a negative relationship between genome size and rate of stem elongation. Based on inferred phylogeographical relationships of invasive and native populations, evolutionary models were consistent with a scenario of genome reduction by natural selection during the invasion process, rather than a scenario of stochastic change. Punctual reduction in genome size could cause rapid changes in key phenotypic traits that enhance invasive ability. Although the generality of genome size variation leading to phenotypic evolution and the specific genomic mechanisms involved are not known, change in genome size may constitute an important but previously under-appreciated mechanism of rapid evolutionary change that may promote evolutionary novelties over short time scales.","[Lavergne, Sebastien; Muenke, Nikolas J.; Molofsky, Jane] Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Lavergne, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France",University of Vermont; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie,"Lavergne, S (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Plant Biol, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",sebastien.lavergne@ujf-grenoble.fr,,,USDA [2003-35320-13503],USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This research was supported by USDA hatch and USDA CSREES award 2003-35320-13503.

Organisms within soil food webs are involved in processes of decomposition and nutrient mineralization, and their abundance and activity have been linked to plant ecophysiological traits such as species identity and the quality and quantity of plant tissue. We tested aboveground-below ground diversity relationships in a naturally developed plant community of native tallgrass prairie by taking soil samples from beneath naturally established grass tillers of chosen characteristics (e.g., homogeneous vs. heterogeneous plant combinations or C-4 vs. C-3 photosynthetic pathway) without imposing any disturbances to existing plant-soil relationships. The goal of this study was to elucidate the consequences, for soil microbiota (microflora phospholipid fatty acids, protozoa, and nematode functional groups) and for C and N mineralization, of plant community properties such as species richness, resource quality, resource heterogeneity, species identity, and presence of exotics. None of the biotic or abiotic soil variables was related to plant resource heterogeneity. Protozoa were not responsive to any of the plant community traits. Some bacterial and nematode groups were affected by plant characteristics specific to a particular plant species, but no uniform pattern emerged. Invasive and native plants generally were similar with respect to soil variables tested in this study. The lack of clear responses of soil variables to plant community traits indicates that idiosyncratic effects dominate both at the plant and soil biotic level and that generalized plant and soil diversity effects are hard to predict.","Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Lancaster, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; Univ Wageningen, Dept Soil Qual, NL-6700 EC Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Colorado State University; Lancaster University; Wageningen University & Research; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Porazinska, DL (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, 3205 Coll Ave, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",dlporazinska@mail.ifas.ufl.edu,"Seastedt, Tim/AAG-1100-2019; Wall, Diana H/F-5491-2011",,,,,,66,209,262,17,286,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

While these factors play a role in determining the potential for invasion. they are often inadequate in predicting the Success of a specific invasion. We show that interactions of an invasive grass with other members of the community determine the local pattern of invasion. A fungus, Ulocladium atrum, aids the establishment of barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) by weakening the grass's tough seed head. thereby accelerating germination and seedling establishment. In contrast, gophers. Thomomys bottae, decrease establishment of this invader by selectively burying patches of goatgrass seedlings under mounds. Plants that survive these gopher disturbance produce seeds that are uninfected by Ulocladium atrum, which may further decrease the establishment of the next generation of goatgrass. A field survey indicated that goatgrass achieves dominance in areas with minimal gopher disturbance. but has limited establishment in pastures with high gopher activity, indicating that the landscape pattern of gopher activity influences patterns of goatgrass invasion by manipulating gopher-plant-fungal interactions.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Eviner, VT (corresponding author), Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.",evinerv@ecostudies.org,"Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020","Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Eviner, Valerie/0000-0001-5530-9417",,,,,68,26,30,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2003,84,1,,,,,120,128,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0120:GPFIAE]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0120:GPFIAE]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,642FC,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000180792700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

A pressing question to address is if plant diversity will increase or decrease in this warming world since contradictory pieces of evidence exit of accelerating plant speciation and plant extinction in the Anthropocene. Results Comparison may be made of the Anthropocene with the past geological times characterised by a warming climate, e.g., the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 55.8 million years ago (Mya)-a period of crocodiles in the Arctic, during which plants saw accelerated speciation through autopolyploid speciation. Three accelerators of plant speciation were reasonably identified in the Anthropocene, including cities, polar regions and botanical gardens where new plant species might be accelerating formed through autopolyploid speciation and hybridization. Conclusions However, this kind of positive effect of climate warming on new plant species formation would be thoroughly offset by direct and indirect intensive human exploitation and human disturbances that cause habitat loss, deforestation, land use change, climate change, and pollution, thus leading to higher extinction risk than speciation in the Anthropocene. At last, four research directions are proposed to deepen our understanding of how plant traits affect speciation and extinction, why we need to make good use of polar regions to study the mechanisms of dispersion and invasion, how to maximize the conservation of plant genetics, species, and diverse landscapes and ecosystems and a holistic perspective on plant speciation and extinction is needed to integrate spatiotemporally.","[Gao, Jian-Guo] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jian-Guo] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, 723 Xingke Rd, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Plant Cell & Chromosome Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jing] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab Genet Engn, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Genet & Dev,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao-Ling] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Kowloon, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Genetics & Developmental Biology, CAS; Fudan University; City University of Hong Kong","Gao, JG (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Gao, JG (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",gaojg@pku.edu.cn,"Liu, Hui/AAF-8803-2021; Zhang, Xiaoling/AAT-4795-2020; Gao, Jianguo/P-5056-2019; Gao, Jianguo/GQH-6435-2022","Liu, Hui/0000-0003-4027-499X; Zhang, Xiaoling/0000-0002-6369-9424; Gao, Jianguo/0000-0001-6966-2502; Gao, Jianguo/0000-0001-6966-2502; Ning, Wang/0000-0002-5019-2747",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670411]; Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou [201806010083]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019339],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670411), the Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou (201806010083), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2019339).

Occasionally invasion occurs where the exotic species possesses functional traits relatively similar to those of the dominant native. We examined the ecological consequences of such an invasion within a mesic, temperate grassland at the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site. We assessed potential changes in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and plant diversity following the invasion of a C-4 bunch grass species, Andropogon bladhii, into a tallgrass prairie dominated by the native C-4 grass species, A. gerardii. In these prairies burning is an important management tool used to maintain native-species dominance. We determined how frequent spring fires affected the impacts of A. bladhii in this system. Over a two-year study our results show that burning regulated the effects that the invasive species has on the native prairie. Compared to the native species, A. bladhii exhibited significantly greater plant biomass, significantly lower pools of soil N, significantly lower rates of decay and C cycling, and higher foliar and root tissue C:N ratio in response to burning. Notable spatial heterogeneity in C and N cycling was evident in areas dominated by the invasive bunch grass. In addition to altered ecosystem processes, areas dominated by the invasive, A. bladhii, had significantly lower plant species diversity. In a grassland ecosystem where burning is an important management tool for controlling exotic-species establishment, maintaining native-species dominance, and increasing productivity, A. bladhii may be able to successfully out-compete the native C-4 grass species by using traits typically used to explain the dominance of the native species. With frequent fire, the invasive species has the potential to decrease long-term fertility by lowering N inputs in litter and increasing erosion in non-vegetated soil between bunches, while also having a negative effect on plant diversity. By using fire to promote native C-4 grasses and maintain these tallgrass prairies, the threat of invasion by normative C-4 species may raise a dilemma for future management of these C-4 grasslands.","Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Kansas State Univ, Dept Biol, Manhattan, KS 66502 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Kansas State University,"Reed, HE (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",Heather_Reed@brown.edu,"Seastedt, Tim/AAG-1100-2019; Blair, John M/I-4082-2014","Blair, John M/0000-0003-0072-0721",,,,,32,67,67,3,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) is an invasive plant of global importance and has a broad distribution along elevational gradients in the Western Himalayas. Our study aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes (e.g. local adaptation and clinal differentiation) and different life history stages in shaping the distribution pattern of the invasive plant along an elevational gradient in the Western Himalaya. We carried out extensive distributional surveys, established a reciprocal transplant experiment with common gardens at three elevational levels, and measured a suite of traits related to germination, growth, reproduction and phenology. Our results showed a lack of local adaptation, and we did not find any evidence for clinal differentiation in any measured trait except a rather weak signal for plant height. We found that seed germination was the crucial life-cycle transition in determining the lower range limit while winter mortality of plants shaped the upper range limit in our study area, thus explaining the hump shaped distribution pattern. Differences in trait values between gardens for most traits indicated a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Possible causes such as apomixis, seed dispersal among sites, and pre-adaptation might have confounded evolutionary processes to act upon. Our results suggest that the success and spread of Ageratina adenophora are dependent on different life history stages at different elevations that are controlled by abiotic conditions.","[Datta, Arunava; Kuehn, Ingolf; Michalski, Stefan; Auge, Harald] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, Halle, Germany; [Kuehn, Ingolf] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, Halle, Germany; [Kuehn, Ingolf; Auge, Harald] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, Leipzig, Germany; [Ahmad, Mustaqeem] CSIR, Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, High Altitude Biol, Palampur, Himachal Prades, India",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT),"Datta, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, Halle, Germany.",arunava.datta@ufz.de,"Kühn, Ingolf/B-9756-2009; Datta, Arunava/AAE-9404-2022; Ahmad, Mustaqeem/P-7367-2019; Auge, Harald/D-4802-2015; Datta, Arunava/AFD-8448-2022; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015","Kühn, Ingolf/0000-0003-1691-8249; Datta, Arunava/0000-0002-3134-491X; Ahmad, Mustaqeem/0000-0002-8454-3891; Auge, Harald/0000-0001-7432-8453; Datta, Arunava/0000-0002-3134-491X; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355",German Academic Exchange Service -DAAD [91541146],German Academic Exchange Service -DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The research was carried as a result of PhD project grant awarded to the 1st author, Arunava Datta, by German Academic Exchange Service -DAAD(91541146).

Such a multitude of introductions makes it difficult to distinguish between alien and native species but provides an excellent opportunity to investigate factors related to introductions and long-term persistence of alien species. In this study, we combined genetic and distribution data to identify the factors promoting the presence of alien reptiles on islands, considering human-related, geographic and species features. Furthermore, we assessed whether the use of genetic evidence to identify alien species improves inference of the factors determining their distribution. Location Mediterranean islands. Methods We combined genetic data and distribution databases to obtain information on biological traits and on the native/alien status of reptiles on >900 Mediterranean islands, and we gathered data on geographic and human features of islands. We then used spatially explicit generalized additive mixed models to identify the factors associated with the establishment of alien reptiles. Results Alien reptile populations are more frequent on islands far from the native range and with large human population. Alien populations of reptiles that are able to feed on plants are particularly frequent. Traditional data sources underestimate the frequency of alien reptiles on Mediterranean islands, and using genetic evidence to assess the status of populations provided a more complete picture of the factors associated with the presence of alien populations. Main conclusions Humans are key drivers of the distribution of alien reptiles on Mediterranean islands, but the distributions are determined by a complex interplay between human activities, geographic factors and species features. Genetic data are essential for obtaining reliable biogeographic assessments of invasive species, particularly in systems with a long history of human influence.","[Silva-Rocha, Iolanda Raquel; Salvi, Daniele; Carretero, Miguel A.] Univ Porto, InBIO, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal; [Silva-Rocha, Iolanda Raquel] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, FCUP, Porto, Portugal; [Silva-Rocha, Iolanda Raquel; Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, LECA, CNRS, Grenoble, France; [Salvi, Daniele] Univ Aquila, Dept Hlth Life & Environm Sci, Coppito, Italy; [Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Biosci, Milan, Italy",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of L'Aquila; University of Milan,"Silva-Rocha, IR (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO CIBIO, Vairao, Portugal.",irsr.14@gmail.com,"Carretero, Miguel A/A-1472-2013; Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/A-2813-2008; Salvi, Daniele/I-6360-2013; Silva-Rocha, Iolanda/I-1989-2014","Carretero, Miguel A/0000-0002-2335-7198; Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/0000-0003-3414-5155; Salvi, Daniele/0000-0002-3804-2690; Silva-Rocha, Iolanda/0000-0001-8451-4460","Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000007, SFRH/BD/95745/2013]; European Research Council [772284]; European Social Fund; Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia; Horizon 2020 [772284]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/95745/2013] Funding Source: FCT","Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia; Horizon 2020; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Grant/Award Number: Rita Levi Montalcini; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000007 and SFRH/BD/95745/2013; European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: Grant Agreement no. 772284; European Social Fund; Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia; European Research Council; Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 772284",,75,16,16,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

SOC density increased by 6.25 Mg ha(-1) following S. alterniflora invasion into P. australis community but decreased by 28.56 and 8.17 Mg ha(-1) following invasion into K. obovata and A. marina communities. Based on field measurements and published literature, we calculated a total inventory of 57 x 10(6) Mg C in the top 1-m soil across China's coastal wetlands. Edaphic variables controlled SOC content, with soil chemical properties explaining the largest variance in SOC content. Climate did not control SOC content but had a strong interactive effect with edaphic variables. Plant biomass and quality traits were a minor contributor in regulating SOC content, highlighting the importance of quantity and quality of OC inputs and the balance between production and degradation within the coastal wetlands. These findings provide new insights into blue C stabilization mechanisms and sequestration capacity in coastal wetlands.","[Xia, Shaopan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Inst Resource Ecosyst & Environm Agr, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Shaopan; Song, Zhaoliang; Li, Qiang; Liu, Cong-Qiang] Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Earth Crit Zone Sci & Sustainable, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Song, Zhaoliang; Liu, Cong-Qiang] Haihe Lab Sustainable Chem Transformat, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Van Zwieten, Lukas] Wollongbar Primary Ind Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Wollongbar, NSW, Australia; [Guo, Laodong] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Yu, Changxun] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kalmar, Sweden; [Wang, Weiqi] Fujian Normal Univ, Key Lab Humid Subtrop Ecogeog Proc, Minist Educ, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Hartley, Iain P.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Yang, Yuanhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongyan] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yidong] Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Water Resources & Environm, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Ran, Xiangbin] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hailong] Foshan Univ, Sch Environm & Chem Engn, Foshan, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hailong] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Nanjing Agricultural University; Tianjin University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Linnaeus University; Fujian Normal University; University of Exeter; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Peking University; Tianjin Normal University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Foshan University; Zhejiang A&F University","Song, ZL (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhaoliang.song@tju.edu.cn,"Van Zwieten, Lukas/U-8486-2018; Hartley, Iain P/J-7892-2016; Wang, Hailong/C-2641-2011","Van Zwieten, Lukas/0000-0002-8832-360X; Hartley, Iain P/0000-0002-9183-6617; Wang, Hailong/0000-0002-6107-5095; Yu, Changxun/0000-0002-0635-3718; Liu, Hongyan/0000-0002-6721-4439","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42141014, 41930862]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20221028]; State's Key Project of Research and Development Plan of China [2016YFA0601002, 2017YFC0212700]; Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); State's Key Project of Research and Development Plan of China; Haihe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations,"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 42141014 and 41930862), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant Nos.

Our work focused on whether the tempo and trajectory of successional development described in the original study have changed over this period during which summer temperatures warmed by approximately 2 degrees C. Our work revealed a rapid increase in the distribution, stature, and abundance of balsam poplar trees that was unanticipated in the original successional model alongside evidence that established late-successional plant communities have changed relatively little over the same time period. The spatial distribution of poplar expansion was both directional and highly variable, with greater expansion occurring in sites that were young surfaces in 1958, or else were disturbed during the intervening period. We present evidence that early successional environments in this region may be particularly susceptible to rapid alteration stimulated by climate warming that has allowed tree establishment and growth in subalpine areas. Sparsely vegetated sites allow for invasion or expansion of some species to be quickly realized because there is less resistance from competition with established vegetation, including mosses that insulate and paludify the soil. We suggest that established vegetation communities may have physical characteristics (such as cold and/or acidic soil profiles) that are inimical to the establishment of balsam poplar and may also be a source of competitive inertia, conferring a measure of resistance to directional changes in the landscape mosaic. However, when an early successional species has traits that allow it to persist and fundamentally alter the vegetation mosaic over time, as is the case with balsam poplar, it may serve as the leading edge of compositional changes with profound consequences. Our results highlight the capacity of a single species to catalyze the changes that may eventually lead to the altering of an entire landscape mosaic.","[Roland, Carl A.; Stehn, Sarah E.; Houseman, Brian] Denali Natl Pk & Preserve, POB 9, Denali Natl Pk, AK 99755 USA; [Roland, Carl A.; Stehn, Sarah E.; Schmidt, Joshua] Natl Pk Serv, Cent Alaska Network, 4175 Geist Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA",United States Department of the Interior,"Roland, CA (corresponding author), Denali Natl Pk & Preserve, POB 9, Denali Natl Pk, AK 99755 USA.;Roland, CA (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, Cent Alaska Network, 4175 Geist Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.",carl_roland@nps.gov,,,Denali National Park and Preserve; Central Alaska Network as part of the U.S. National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program,Denali National Park and Preserve; Central Alaska Network as part of the U.S. National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program,"This work is dedicated to L.

Only recently, there is an increasing recognition that integrating these two questions offers new insights into the mechanisms of biological invasions. This recognition has renewed the interest in two long-standing and seemingly contradictory hypotheses proposed by Darwin: phylogenetic relatedness of invaders to native communities is predicted to promote naturalization because of appropriate niche-adaptation but is at the same time predicted to hamper naturalization because of niche overlap with native species. The latter is known as Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. Location Global. Methods and Results We review the studies that have tested these hypotheses and summarize their largely inconsistent outcomes. We argue that most of the inconsistency arises from discrepancies in the applied conceptual frameworks and analytical approaches and not from different model organisms and different ecological contexts. First, observed patterns and results can be seriously flawed by different spatial and phylogenetic scales, which do not equally reveal community assembly mechanisms. Second, different studies have used different metrics, which may test for different specific hypotheses. Thus, we propose a set of metrics derived from the alpha niche concept to measure invaders relatedness to native communities. Finally, approximating species niche differentiation from phylogenetic relatedness is not exempt of assumptions, and invasive species naturalization may result from various ecological mechanisms of biotic resistance that are not necessarily revealed by species phylogeny alone. Main conclusions The quest for resolving the conundrum of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis will only be successful if appropriate scales, metrics and analytical tests are thoroughly considered. We give several recommendations and suggest, whenever possible, to use trait-based measurements of species dissimilarity as the most promising avenue to unravel the mechanisms driving alien species invasions.","[Thuiller, Wilfried; Gallien, Laure; Boulangeat, Isabelle; de Bello, Francesco; Muenkemueller, Tamara; Roquet, Cristina; Lavergne, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie,"Thuiller, W (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",wilfried.thuiller@ujf-grenoble.fr,"Münkemüller, Tamara/AAQ-1670-2020; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Roquet, Cristina/AAB-4031-2019; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; Gallien, Laure/G-8384-2014","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Roquet, Cristina/0000-0001-8748-3743; Gallien, Laure/0000-0003-4882-1580",ANR SCION [ANR-08-PEXT-03]; DIVERSITALP [ANR-07-BDIV-014]; European Commission [066866 GOCE],ANR SCION(French National Research Agency (ANR)); DIVERSITALP; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"We thank David Richardson for the invitation to write this opinion paper and for his insightful comments and editions on the manuscript.

However, still little is known about how latitudinal heterogeneity in herbivore pressure influences latitudinal variation in defense phenotypes of invasive plants. We tested how latitudinal patterns in multi-variate defense syndromes differed between native (Argentinian) and introduced (Chinese) populations of the invasive herb Alternanthera philoxeroides. In addition, to better understand the drivers underlying latitudinal patterns, we also tested whether associations of defense syndromes with climate and herbivory differed between native and introduced ranges. We found that native plant populations clustered into three main defense syndromes associated with latitude. In contrast, we only found two defense syndromes in the introduced range. One matched the high-latitude syndrome from the native range, but was distributed at both the northern and southern range limits in the introduced range. The other was unique to the introduced range and occurred at mid-latitudes. Climatic conditions were associated with variation in syndromes in the native range, and climatic conditions and herbivory were associated with variation in syndromes in the introduced range. Together, our results demonstrate that plants may under the new environmental conditions in the introduced range show latitudinal patterns of defense syndromes that are different from those in their native range. This emphasizes that geographical dependence of population differentiation should be explicitly considered in studies on the evolution of defense in invasive plants.","[Liu, Mu; Pan, Yuanfei; Pan, Xiaoyun; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn,Inst Biodivers, Minist Educ,Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosy, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Liu, Mu; Pan, Yuanfei; Pan, Xiaoyun; Li, Bo] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecochongming, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Pan, Yuanfei] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Pan, Xiaoyun] Tibet Univ, Coll Sci, Res Ctr Ecol, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Pan, Xiaoyun] Fudan Univ, Tibet Univ Fudan Univ Joint Lab Biodivers & Globa, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Sosa, Alejandro] Fdn Estudio Especies Invas FuEDEI, RA-999071 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sosa, Alejandro] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, RA-999071 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Blumenthal, Dana M.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Van Kleunen, Mark] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Ecol, D-78464 Constance, Germany; [Van Kleunen, Mark] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University; Tibet University; Fudan University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Konstanz; Taizhou University,"Pan, XY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn,Inst Biodivers, Minist Educ,Natl Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosy, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Pan, XY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Ecochongming, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.;Pan, XY (corresponding author), Tibet Univ, Coll Sci, Res Ctr Ecol, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China.;Pan, XY (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Tibet Univ Fudan Univ Joint Lab Biodivers & Globa, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China.",xypan@fudan.edu.cn,"van Kleunen, Mark/B-3769-2009; Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","van Kleunen, Mark/0000-0002-2861-3701; Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666; Pan, Yuanfei/0000-0001-7450-9334","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771053, 32071659, 31961133028, 32030067]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41771053; No. 32071659; No. 31961133028; No. 32030067).

On islands off the coast of New Zealand, seabird-dominated islands support greater densities of soil- and litter-dwelling consumer biota. We predicted that islands with high seabird densities would have higher levels of leaf damage as a result of higher densities of foliar consumers (herbivores and pathogens). Damage levels on leaves of six common tree species were compared between 9 islands with active seabird colonies and 10 islands with low seabird densities resulting from invasion by predatory rats. There were no consistent differences in leaf damage by chewing, mining, or phloem-feeding herbivores across plant species; pathogen damage was lower on islands with high seabird densities than on those with low densities, but this was driven by only two of the plant species. Instead, plant species differed in which of several possible damage types responded to seabird presence, and in which plant leaf traits responded to seabird-related environmental changes. Across plant species, those with more resource-acquisitive leaf traits such as high percent nitrogen and low structural investment experienced higher levels of chewing damage (which accounted for 66-100% of all damage), but not other damage types. We conclude that the fertilisation and disturbance regimes imposed by seabirds do not lead to consistent changes in consumer damage to plants, because of variable responses by both individual plant species and different consumer groups.","[Mulder, Christa P.

The basic hypothesis is that an extensive cattle grazing of its habitats (flood meadows) provides an optimum disturbance regime for long-term persistence of the species. Spatial and temporal scales of the investigation were adapted to the dimensions of the most prominent disturbance impacts (rotation grazing and hoof trampling by cattle) and response rates of Apium which are mainly controlled by stolon propagation. A total of 603 microplots, each measuring 10 cm x 10 cm, were arranged within three transects and surveyed for two seasons. Statistical analyses include spatial second order statistics and mixed linear models. Random Apium extinctions during grazing periods and fast re-invasions of gaps during subsequent resting periods result in strong population fluctuations. The probability of re-invasion depends on the distance to next Apium plant which must not exceed much more than 1 dm. The morphological plasticity of stolon length indicates presence of foraging behaviour which facilitates the preoccupation of favourable gaps. Disturbances favour the coexistence of A. repens in the pasture due to a combined effect of reduced shoot competition (destruction of tall competitors) and more efficient foraging strategies. Attempts to explain Apium coexistence in these flood meadows must take into account both the fine-tuned balance between different disturbance parameters and corresponding functional plants traits.

Essential to predicting the consequences of climate change to individual species will be an understanding of the factors that drive genetic structure within and among populations. Here, I review the factors that influence the genetic structure of plant species in California, but are applicable elsewhere; existing levels of genetic variation, life history and ecological characteristics will affect the ability of an individual taxon to persist in the presence of anthropogenic change. Factors influencing the distribution of genetic variation Persistence in the face of climate change is likely determined by life history characteristics: dispersal ability, generation time, reproductive ability, degree of habitat specialization, plant-insect interactions, existing genetic diversity and availability of habitat or migration corridors. Existing levels of genetic diversity in plant populations vary based on a number of evolutionary scenarios that include endemism, expansion since the last glacial maximum, breeding system and current range sizes. Regional priorities and examples A number of well-documented examples are provided from the California Floristic Province. Some predictions can be made for the responses of plant taxa to rapid environmental changes based on geographic position, evolutionary history, existing genetic variation, and ecological amplitude. Conclusions, Solutions and Recommendations The prediction of how species will respond to climate change will require a synthesis drawing from population genetics, geography, palaeontology and ecology. The important integration of the historical factors that have shaped the distribution and existing genetic structure of California's plant taxa will enable us to predict and prioritize the conservation of species and areas most likely to be impacted by rapid climate change, human disturbance and invasive species.","[Schierenbeck, Kristina A.] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Biol Sci, Chico, CA 95929 USA",California State University System; California State University Chico,"Schierenbeck, KA (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Biol Sci, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",kschierenbeck@csuchico.edu,,,,,,,172,35,38,6,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Since then, a toolbox of indices and statistical approaches has been developed and commonly applied to test for the relative importance of these drivers. This toolbox is largely based on community ecology theory with the underlying hypothesis that patterns of trait (or phylogenetic) similarities between invaders and native species permit to disentangle the signatures of competition and environmental filtering. However, so far the performance of the indices and statistical approaches has not been thoroughly evaluated, and there exists no study exploring the sensitivity of the different methods given common biases in field data. This severely hampers intercomparisons of invasion studies and ultimately prevents the elaboration of general conclusions. In this study, we developed a mechanistic community assembly model to simulate invasion patterns across a range of communities and tested the performance of four different indices aiming at disentangling environmental filtering vs. competition from these patterns. Furthermore, we evaluated the sensitivity of the statistical methods to biases in the data (resulting from non-equilibrium dynamics or observation errors). Our results indicated that the best performing index was mean distance to the native species (the average functional distance between the invader and all the species of the community), especially in heterogeneous landscapes. Further, we demonstrated that the detection of competition was more sensitive to the presence of biases in the data than the detection of environmental filtering. In conclusion, studying invasion mechanisms based on community patterns is possible when employing the appropriate statistical method, but it is highly sensitive to the quality of the data set used.","[Gallien, Laure] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Carboni, Marta; Muenkemueller, Tamara] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Carboni, Marta; Muenkemueller, Tamara] CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie","Gallien, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",laure.gallien@gmail.com,"Münkemüller, Tamara/AAQ-1670-2020; Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012; Gallien, Laure/G-8384-2014","Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758; Gallien, Laure/0000-0003-4882-1580",European Research Council under the European Community [281422 (TEEMBIO)]; ANR-BiodivERsA project CONNECT as part of the ERA-Net BiodivERsA [ANR-11-EBID-002]; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (IASIMOV),European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); ANR-BiodivERsA project CONNECT as part of the ERA-Net BiodivERsA(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (IASIMOV),"The authors would like to particularly thank W.

Plant functional response to nutrient availability, and what this tells us about plant interactions with associated species, may therefore give us clues about underlying processes related to plant abundance and invasion. Patterns of abundance of Hieracium lepidulum, a European herbaceous invader of subalpine New Zealand, appear to be related to soil fertility/nutrient availability, however, abundance may be influenced by other factors including disturbance. In this study we compare H. lepidulum and field co-occurring species for growth performance across artificial nutrient concentration gradients, for relative competitiveness and for response to disturbance, to construct a functional profile of the species. Hieracium lepidulum was found to be significantly different in its functional response to nutrient concentration gradients. Hieracium lepidulum had high relative growth rate, high yield and root plasticity in response to nutrient concentration dilution, relatively low absolute yield, low competitive yield and a positive response to clipping disturbance relative to other species. Based on overall functional response to nutrient concentration gradients, compared with other species found at the same field sites, we hypothesize that H. lepidulum invasion is not related to competitive domination. Relatively low tolerance of nutrient dilution leads us to predict that H. lepidulum is likely to be restricted from invading low fertility sites, including sites within alpine vegetation or where intact high biomass plant communities are found. Positive response to clipping disturbance and relatively high nutrient requirement, despite poor competitive performance, leads us to predict that H. lepidulum may respond to selective grazing disturbance of associated vegetation. These results are discussed in relation to published observations of H. lepidulum in New Zealand and possible tests for the hypotheses raised here.","Univ Otago, Dept Bot, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Radford, IJ (corresponding author), Dept Environm & Conservat, POB 942, Kununurra, WA 6743, Australia.",ian.radford@dec.wa.gov.au,"Lord, Janice Marjorie/A-8869-2012; Dickinson, Katharine/M-1728-2017","Lord, Janice Marjorie/0000-0001-8314-0428; Dickinson, Katharine/0000-0001-6769-552X",,,,,88,17,19,1,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,MAY,2007,32,3,,,,,338,354,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01700.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01700.x,,,17,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,150NP,,,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000245223800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In an infestation of Centaurea stoebe (spotted knapweed) located in the Colorado foothills, we measured physiology, biomass, and flower production of individual plants undergoing a natural range of herbivory by the above- and belowground biological control insects, Larinus minutus and Cyphocleonus achates. Over the growing season, net carbon assimilation rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and intercellular leaf [CO2] (C i) all decreased, while water use efficiency increased. The decrease in these physiological traits was due to an increase in the intensity of L. minutus damage over time; effects of C. achates root damage to plant physiology, including transpiration were only marginally significant. The effects of these two species on plant physiology were not interactive, and Larinus minutus was found to exert larger negative effects on this invasive plant in terms of plant physiology and potential reproductive output than C. achates. While previous studies have shown C. achates to have significant negative effects on population densities of spotted knapweed, the addition of Larinus minutus to the suite of insects used in biological control of spotted knapweed should facilitate continued or enhanced reduction in densities of this noxious weed.","[Seastedt, Timothy R.; Knochel, David G.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Seastedt, Timothy R.; Knochel, David G.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wooley, Stuart C.; Smith, Bonnie; King, Chad] Calif State Univ Stanislaus, Dept Biol Sci, Turlock, CA 95382 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California State University System; California State University Stanislaus,"Knochel, DG (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Campus Box 450, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.knochel@colorado.edu,"Seastedt, Tim/AAG-1100-2019","Knochel, David/0000-0003-4247-8873; SEASTEDT, TIM/0000-0001-5079-7511","USDA Faculty and Student Team (FAST) program under the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [TEXE-2008-02095]; USDA NRI CSREES program [2009-55320-05072]","USDA Faculty and Student Team (FAST) program under the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service; USDA NRI CSREES program","We thank Linda and Sergio Sanabria for use of their land to conduct research, as well as laboratory assistance from Christopher Washenberger.

Here we present the conceptual basis for experiments focused on manipulating clonal attributes in a community context to determine how clonal characteristics affect interactions among plants at both the individual and community levels. All treatments are replicated at low and high density in a community density series to compare plant responses in environments of different competitive intensity. We examine clonal integration, the sharing of resources among ramets, by severing ramets from one another and comparing their response to ramets with intact connections. Ramet aggregation, the spacing of ramets relative to each other, is investigated by comparing species that differ in their natural aggregation (either clumped growth forms, with ramets tightly packed together, or runner growth forms, with ramets loosely spread) and by planting individual ramets of all species evenly spaced throughout a mesocosm. We illustrate how to test predictions to examine the influence of these two clonal traits on competitive interactions at the individual and community levels. To evaluate the effect of clonal integration on competition, we test two predictions: at the individual level, species with greater clonal integration will be better individual-level competitors, and at the community level, competition will cause a greater change in community composition when ramets are integrated (connected) than when they are not. For aggregation we test at the individual level: clumped growth forms are better competitors than runner growth forms because of their ability to resist invasion, and at the community level: competition will have a greater effect on community structure when ramets are evenly planted. An additional prediction connects the individual- and community-level effects of competition: resistance ability better predicts the effects of competition on relative abundance in a community than does invasion ability. We discuss additional experimental design considerations as revealed by our ongoing studies. Examining how clonal attributes affect both the individual- and community-level effects of competition requires new methods and metrics such as those presented here, and is vital to understanding the role of clonality in community structure of many ecosystems.","Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Gough, L (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",lgough@biology.as.ua.edu,,,,,,,47,42,43,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

This is because many biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors interact to determine the distribution of invasive species. However, in this paper we also argue that many analyses of invasiveness have been flawed by not considering several fundamental issues: (1) the range size of an invasive species depends on how much time it has had to spread (its residence time); (2) the range size and spread rate are mediated by the total extent of suitable (i.e. potentially invasible) habitat; and (3) the range size and spread rate depend on the frequency and intensity of introductions (propagule pressure), the position of founder populations in relation to the potential range, and the spatial distribution of the potential range. We explored these considerations using a large set of invasive alien plant species in South Africa for which accurate distribution data and other relevant information were available. Species introduced earlier and those with larger potential ranges had larger current range sizes, but we found no significant effect of the spatial distribution of potential ranges on current range sizes, and data on propagule pressure were largely unavailable. However, crucially, we showed that: (1) including residence time and potential range always significantly increases the explanatory power of the models; and (2) residence time and potential range can affect which factors emerge as significant determinants of invasiveness. Therefore, analyses not including potential range and residence time can come to misleading conclusions. When these factors were taken into account, we found that nitrogen-fixing plants and plants invading arid regions have spread faster than other species, but these results were phylogenetically constrained. We also show that, when analysed in the context of residence time and potential range, variation in range size among invasive species is implicitly due to variation in spread rates, and, that by explicitly assuming a particular model of spread, it is possible to estimate changes in the rates of plant invasions through time. We believe that invasion biology can develop generalizations that are useful for management, but only in the context of a suitable null model.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa; S African Natl Biodivers Inst, ARC Plant Protect Res Inst, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble, France",Stellenbosch University; South African National Biodiversity Institute; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie,"Richardson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Matieland, South Africa.",rich@sun.ac.za,"Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Procheş, Şerban/A-2044-2008; Rouget, Mathieu/B-7249-2008; Wilson, John/B-4101-2008","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Procheş, Şerban/0000-0002-3415-6930; Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0003-1836-7727; Wilson, John/0000-0003-0174-3239; Rouget, Mathieu/0000-0002-6172-3152",,,,,58,275,282,0,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

(raspberry and blackberry). Several traits of interest fail to express in seedlings or reliably in some environments and are candidates for marker-assisted selection. A growing number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers derived from Rubus and Fragaria L. (strawberry) are available for use with Rubus mapping populations. The objectives of this study were to test 142 of these SSR markers to screen raspberry and blackberry parental genotypes for potential use in existing mapping populations that segregate for traits of interest, determine the extent of inter-species and inter-genera transferability with amplification, and determine the level of polymorphism among the parents. Up to 32 of the SSR primer pairs tested may be useful for genetic mapping in both the blackberry population and at least one of the raspberry populations. The maximum number of SSR primer pairs found useable for mapping was 60 for the raspberry population and 45 for the blackberry population. Acquisition of many more nucleotide sequences from red raspberry, black raspberry, and blackberry are required to develop useful molecular markers and genetic maps for these species. Rubus, family Rosaceae, is a highly diverse genus that contains hundreds of heterozygous species. The family is one of the most agronomically important plant families in temperate regions of the world, although they also occur in tropical and arctic regions as well. The most important commercial subgenus of Rubus is Idaeobatus Focke, the raspberries, which are primarily diploids. This subgenus contains the european red raspberry R. idaeus ssp. idaeus L., as well as the american black raspberry R. occidentalis L. and the american red raspberry R. idaeus ssp. strigosus Michx. Interspecific hybridization of these, and other raspberry species, has led to greater genetic diversity and allowed for the introgression of superior traits such as large fruit size, fruit firmness and quality, disease resistance, and winter hardiness.","USDA ARS, Fruit Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA; Scottish Crop Res Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; New York State Agr Exptl Stn, Dept Hort Sci, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; Univ Arkansas, Dept Hort, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); James Hutton Institute; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Lewers, KS (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Fruit Lab, 10300 Baltimore Ave,BARC W Bldg 010A, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA.",lewersk@ba.ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,51,30,37,1,35,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0003-1062,2327-9788,,J AM SOC HORTIC SCI,J.

Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of antplant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent syndrome attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora.","[Junker, Robert R.; Bluethgen, Nico] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Biozentrum, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Daehler, Curtis C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Doetterl, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Systemat, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Keller, Alexander] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Bioinformat, Biozentrum, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Bayreuth; University of Wurzburg,"Bluthgen, N (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Biozentrum, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",bluethgen@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Keller, Alexander/D-1221-2009; Blüthgen, Nico/F-5983-2010","Keller, Alexander/0000-0001-5716-3634; Dotterl, Stefan/0000-0001-5228-1332; Bluthgen, Nico/0000-0001-6349-4528",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [BL 960/1-1]; Evangelisches Studienwerk e.V.

Strong relatedness of invaders to native communities as an indication of niche overlap could promote naturalization because of appropriate niche adaptation, but could also hamper naturalization because of negative interactions with native species (Darwin's naturalization hypothesis'). Although these hypotheses provide clear and opposing predictions for expected patterns of species relatedness in invaded communities, so far no study has been able to clearly disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesize that conflicting past results are mainly due to the neglected role of spatial resolution of the community sampling. In this study, we corroborate both of Darwin's expectations by using phylogenetic relatedness as a measure of niche overlap and by testing the effects of sampling resolution in highly invaded coastal plant communities. At spatial resolutions fine enough to detect signatures of biotic interactions, we find that most invaders are less related to their nearest relative in invaded plant communities than expected by chance (phylogenetic overdispersion). Yet at coarser spatial resolutions, native assemblages become more invasible for closely-related species as a consequence of habitat filtering (phylogenetic clustering). Recognition of the importance of the spatial resolution at which communities are studied allows apparently contrasting theoretical and empirical results to be reconciled. Our study opens new perspectives on how to better detect, differentiate and understand the impact of negative biotic interactions and habitat filtering on the ability of invaders to establish in native communities.","[Carboni, Marta; Acosta, Alicia] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, IT-00146 Rome, Italy; [Carboni, Marta; Muenkemueller, Tamara; Gallien, Laure; Lavergne, Sebastien; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, FR-38041 Grenoble, France",Roma Tre University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie,"Carboni, M (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Biol Ambientale, Vle Marconi 446, IT-00146 Rome, Italy.",mcarboni@uniroma3.it,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Münkemüller, Tamara/AAQ-1670-2020; Alicia T.

Invaders can influence freshwater systems at the individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Some of these impacts may be subtle or not easily predicted but they may be critical to understanding more obvious changes. Despite this, studies of impacts of freshwater invaders at several levels of ecological organisation are rare. Most commonly reported are changes in the distribution or abundance of populations after invasion, whereas documentation of impacts on ecosystem functioning, such as energy and nutrient flux, is rare. 2. Unlike most invaders, salmonids have been studied at multiple ecological levels. These fish can cause trophic cascades that result in increased algal biomass and production and are responsible for changes to energy and nutrient flux in both streams and lakes. The mechanisms behind these changes are different in the two systems and only become evident when information at the individual and population levels are considered. In streams, salmonids can alter invertebrate behaviour that suppresses grazing of periphyton. In lakes, salmonid feeding behaviour can stimulate phytoplankton by shunting nutrients from the littoral to the pelagic zone. 3. Simultaneous study at several ecological levels should yield a fuller understanding of the mechanisms underlying impacts of invading animals and plants, providing a sounder basis for predicting the impacts of freshwater invasive species. Species traits of the invaders that may be associated with particularly profound impacts include: a method of resource acquisition formerly lacking in the invaded system, a broad feeding niche that links previously unlinked ecosystem compartments, a feeding relationship with negative consequences for native strong interactors, physiological traits that enhance resource transformation and lead to high biomass, and behavioural or demographic traits that provide high resistance or resilience in the face of natural disturbances.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Simon, KS (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Dept Biol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",simonks@jmu.edu,"Townsend, Colin/AAZ-2027-2020; Simon, Kevin Scott/CAH-1516-2022","Simon, Kevin/0000-0002-9537-2450",,,,,83,254,269,3,178,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Here, I examine the strength of floral isolation and interspecific pollen-pistil barriers between an invasive apomictic, Taraxacum officinale, and the indigenous sexual alpine dandelion, Taraxacum ceratophorum. Experimental arrays of either native inflorescences or a mixture of native and exotic inflorescences were used to examine insect preference and to track movement of a pollen analog. Using hand-pollinations, conspecific and heterospecific pollen germination success on native stigmas was compared. To additionally test for interspecific pollen competition, T. ceratophorum plants received one of three possible hand-pollinations: control conspecific pollination, concomitant conspecific and heterospecific pollination (mixed), or conspecific pollen followed by heterospecific pollen 15 min later (staggered). Floral isolation was negligible as no insect preference was detected. On a presence/absence basis, florets on native inflorescences received slightly less pollen analog from heterospecific donors than from conspecific donors; however, the amount of dye particles transferred from either Taraxacum species to stigmas on recipient T. ceratophorum inflorescences was equivalent. In contrast to weak floral isolation, strong pollen germination and pollen competition barriers should reduce the potential for hybridization. Heterospecific T. officinale pollen exhibited reduced germination success on T. ceratophorum stigmas in comparison to conspecific pollen. Furthermore, a significant pollen-competition effect on the percentage of hybrid offspring was detected only when T. officinale preceded T. ceratophorum pollen by 15 min. This result indicates that conspecific pollen out-competes heterospecific pollen but further suggests that biotic and abiotic factors reducing pollen accrual rates may partially remove barriers to natural hybridization.","[Brock, Marcus T.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Brock, MT (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",mbrock2@uwyo.edu,,,"Department of Biological Sciences-Columbia; NSF [DEB-0087412, DBI-0227103]",Department of Biological Sciences-Columbia; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank C.

This study relates such variability to multiple concurrent environmental factors. Specifically we determined the relative importance of salinity, depth, wave exposure, habitat and shell type' (shell type combined species, size, morphology and mobility traits) for community structure of sessile epibiota on gastropods in the Swan River Estuary, Australia. We quantified distribution, biofouling patterns, and detailed epibiota community structures on gastropod species in the estuary - the native Nassarius pauperatus and Bedeva paiva and the invasive Batillaria australis. The invasive Batillaria was much more abundant, and more biofouled, than any of the native species, thereby supporting orders of magnitude more epibiota in the estuary. Generalised linear models were used to partition variation in richness and abundance of epibiota among the above listed factors. Of the five factors were only shell type and salinity significant in 9 of 14 models. These results highlight (1) that a single invasive species can alter epibiota communities on a large system-wide scale, (2) an overwhelming importance of shell type and salinity in explaining estuarine epibiota communities, and (3) that additional environmental factors need to be included in future studies to improve predictive models of distribution for epibiota communities.","[Thyrring, Jakob] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Thomsen, Mads Solgaard] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Ecol Res Grp, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Thomsen, Mads Solgaard; Wernberg, Thomas] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Thomsen, Mads Solgaard; Wernberg, Thomas] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Brunbjerg, Ane Kirstine] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Aarhus University; University of Canterbury; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Birmingham,"Thyrring, J (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Arctic Res Ctr, CF Mollers Alle 8,Bldg 1110, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",thyrring@bios.au.dk,"Wernberg, Thomas/B-4172-2010; Thyrring, Jakob/M-9479-2015","Wernberg, Thomas/0000-0003-1185-9745; Thyrring, Jakob/0000-0002-1029-3105; Brunbjerg, Ane Kirstine/0000-0003-0666-6535; Thomsen, Mads/0000-0003-4597-3343",Oticon Fonden; Rising Star travel grant from Australian National Network in Marine Science; Marsden Fund of Royal Society of New Zealand [13-UOC-106]; Carlsberg Foundation; Australian Research Council,Oticon Fonden; Rising Star travel grant from Australian National Network in Marine Science; Marsden Fund of Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"JT was supported by a travel grant from Oticon Fonden, MST was supported by a Rising Star travel grant from the Australian National Network in Marine Science and the Marsden Fund of the Royal Society of New Zealand (13-UOC-106), AKB was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation and TW was supported by the Australian Research Council.",,43,4,4,1,24,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

In the middle Rhone floodplain (France), we measured survival and growth of transplants of the invasive and of three native tree species from contrasted successional status within forests and in experimental gaps and at three positions along a riparian gradient: (i) a highly disturbed Salix-Populus stand, (ii) a moderately disturbed stand dominated by the invasive Acer, and (iii) a mature Fraxinus community. Acer's growth in the gaps was as high as that of the two native early-successional species, Salix and Populus, and higher than that of the native late-successional Fraxinus. In contrast, Acer survived as well in the shadiest understory conditions of the Fraxinus community as did Fraxinus and better than the two early-successional species. Inconsistent with the resource trade-off of succession theory, Acer showed both a high survival in the shade and a high growth in full light. This particular suite of traits shared with other invasive and native Acer species could be an example of adaptive plasticity that certainly represents an advantage to give it a competitive advantage over native species.","[Saccone, Patrick; Brun, Jean-Jacques] Irstea, RU Mt Ecosyst, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Michalet, Richard] Univ Bordeaux 1, UMR INRA BIOGECO 1202, F-33405 Talence, France",INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Saccone, P (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS UMR 5553, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble 09, France.",patrick.saccone@gmail.com,"Saccone, Patrick/AHB-2366-2022","Saccone, Patrick/0000-0001-8820-593X",French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development,French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development,"We thank the Amis de la Reserve Naturelle de l'Ile de la Platiere'', which provided the sites for this experiment, and in particular Bernard Pont for his help during fieldwork and his advice on site selection.

The temporal and spatial patterns of these vegetation changes hold potential information to their causes and triggers. Here we test the hypothesis that the timing of vegetation change was synchronous on a sub-continental scale, which implies a common trigger or a step-like change in climate parameters. Pollen diagrams from selected European regions were statistically divided into assemblage zones and the temporal pattern of the zone boundaries analysed. The results show that the temporal pattern of vegetation change was significantly different from random. Times of change cluster around 8.2, 4.8, 3.7, and 1.2 ka, while times of higher than average stability were found around 2.1 and 5.1 ka. Compositional changes linked to the expansion of Corylus avellana and Alnus glutinosa centre around 10.6 and 9.5 ka, respectively. A climatic trigger initiating these changes may have occurred 0.5 to 1 ka earlier, respectively. The synchronous expansion of C avellana and A. glutinosa exemplify that dispersal is not necessarily followed by population expansion. The partly synchronous, partly random expansion of A. glutinosa in adjacent European regions exemplifies that sudden synchronous population expansions are not species specific traits but vary regionally.

Location Forest-meadow mosaic, 1350 m a.s.l., Cascade Range, Oregon, US. Methods We combined spatial point pattern analysis, population age structures, and a time-series of stem maps to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of conifer invasion over a 200-yr period in three plots totaling 4 ha. Results Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s). Recent invasion was not correlated with climatic variation. Abies grandis dominated both periods; P. contorta established at lower density, peaking before A. grandis. Spatially, older (>= 90 yr) P. contorta were randomly distributed, but older A. grandis were strongly clumped (0.2-20 m). Younger (< 90 yr) stems were positively associated at small distances (both within and between species), but were spatially displaced from older A. grandis, suggesting a temporal shift from facilitation to competition. Establishment during the 1800s resulted in widely scattered P. contorta and clumps of A. grandis that placed most areas of meadow close to seed sources permitting more rapid invasion during the mid-1900s. Rapid conversion to forest occurred via colonization of larger meadow openings - first by shade-intolerant P. contorta, then by shade-tolerant A. grandis - and by direct infilling of smaller openings by A. grandis. Conclusions In combination, spatial and temporal patterns of establishment suggest an invasion process shaped by biotic interactions, with facilitation promoting expansion of trees into meadows and competition influencing subsequent forest development. Once invasion is initiated, tree species with different life histories and functional traits can interact synergistically to promote rapid conversion of meadow to forest under a broad range of climatic conditions.","[Halpern, Charles B.; Haugo, Ryan D.; Lang, Nicole L.] Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Antos, Joseph A.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; [Rice, Janine M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Victoria; Oregon State University,"Halpern, CB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Forest Resources, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",chalpern@u.washington.edu; jantos@uvic.ca; ricejan@science.oregonstate.edu; haugor@u.washington.edu; nlang25@yahoo.com,,,NSF IG-ERT [NSF DGE-0333257]; Joint Fire Science Program [1422RAH03-0021],NSF IG-ERT(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Joint Fire Science Program,"For field assistance we thank Michael Frank, James Freund, Marcus Koch, Jennifer Leach, James Lutz, Jessica Niederer, Kyle Smith, Florian Steer, Katrin Wendt, and Tina Volkl.

We studied 18 forested, offshore islands in northern New Zealand. Nine of these host high densities of burrowing seabirds that serve as ecosystem drivers by transporting nutrients from the ocean to land. The other nine have been invaded over the past 50-150 years by rat species introduced from Europe which serve as predators of seabird eggs and chicks and severely reduce their densities. We collected fully expanded leaves and fresh leaf litter from invaded and uninvaded islands for each of 12 perennial plant species that represent a wide spectrum of life forms from ground dwelling to emergent canopy species. We found that, across these species, invasion by rats significantly reduced nitrogen (N) but not phosphorus (P) concentrations of foliage and litter, promoted N but not P resorption from leaves before litter fall, and reduced the release of N but not P from decomposing litter. Rat invasion also negatively affected litter decomposability but had no overall effects on litter quality variables other than N. Our results provide evidence that rat invasion causes more conservative cycling of N but not P through foliage and litter and limitation of ecological processes by N but not P. We found few instances in which the effects of rat invasion on response variables varied significantly across plant species, meaning that invasion had similar effects for species that varied greatly in growth form and foliar and litter quality. Further, correlation analyses across the 12 species showed that foliar and litter quality traits were poor predictors of how invasion effects on resorption and decomposition variables varied among species. Our results show that the effects of invasive predators on native prey can have substantial indirect effects on variables relevant for ecosystem functioning. These types of effects are probably widespread, especially given the role of seabirds in improving soil fertility in many coastal ecosystems worldwide and the wide global distribution of predators of seabirds.","[Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Wardle, David A.; Bellingham, Peter J.; Bonner, Karen I.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Mulder, Christa P.

As climate regimes continue to change, it is likely that a new suite of invaders will emerge from the established pool of naturalised plants. Pre-emptive management of locations that may be most suitable for a large number of potentially invasive plants will help to target monitoring, and is vital for effective control. We used species distribution models (SDM) and invasion-hotspot analysis to determine where in Australia suitable habitat may occur for 292 naturalised plants. SDMs were built in MaxEnt using both climate and soil variables for current baseline conditions. Modelled relationships were projected onto two Representative Concentration Pathways for future climates (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), based on seven global climate models, for two time periods (2035, 2065). Model outputs for each of the 292 species were then aggregated into single 'hotspot' maps at two scales: continental, and for each of Australia's 37 ecoregions. Across Australia, areas in the south-east and south-west corners of the continent were identified as potential hotspots for naturalised plants under current and future climates. These regions provided suitable habitat for 288 and 239 species respectively under baseline climates. The areal extent of the continental hotspot was projected to decrease by 8.8% under climates for 2035, and by a further 5.2% by 2065. A similar pattern of hotspot contraction under future climates was seen for the majority of ecoregions examined. However, two ecoregions - Tasmanian temperate forests and Australian Alps montane grasslands - showed increases in the areal extent of hotspots of >45% under climate scenarios for 2065. The alpine ecoregion also had an increase in the number of naturalised plant species with abiotically suitable habitat under future climate scenarios, indicating that this area may be particularly vulnerable to future incursions by naturalised plants.","[Duursma, Daisy Englert; Gallagher, Rachael V.; Roger, Erin; Hughes, Lesley; Leishman, Michelle R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie PK, Australia; [Downey, Paul O.] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Canberra,"Gallagher, RV (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie PK, Australia.",rachael.gallagher@mq.edu.au,"Leishman, Michelle/AAU-4102-2020; Leishman, Michelle M/G-9726-2012","Leishman, Michelle/0000-0003-4830-5797; Leishman, Michelle M/0000-0003-4830-5797; Downey, Paul/0000-0002-8867-248X; Hughes, Lesley/0000-0003-0313-9780; Roger, Erin/0000-0002-9671-132X; Gallagher, Rachael/0000-0002-4680-8115",National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility; Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University,National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility; Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University,"This work was funded by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.

Climate is often the primary component of the abiotic (fundamental) niche, especially among terrestrial plants. In invasion biology, there is an ongoing debate on the prevalence of niche shifts, which may be linked to divergent traits in a species' native and invaded ranges, as well as dispersal limitations and invasion lag phases. Using a global dataset, we tested whether shifts occurred in the invader Johnsongrass (Sorghum hale-pense), which has undergone intercontinental spread as well as habitat-switching within its invaded range in North America. Climate space ordination showed that North America is, on average, colder than Afro-Eurasia, and North American Johnsongrass occupies wetter environ-ments than in its native range. Within North America, both agricultural and non-agricultural ecotypes shifted slightly toward colder climates. Notably, while non-agricultural populations far outnumber agricultural ones, the former occupy a narrower niche (DM = 42.7 +/- 0.8) than the latter (DM = 59.3 +/- 1.1), implying agriculture's role in providing suitable environments in otherwise suboptimal climates. Maximum entropy models of agricultural and non-agricultural North American populations showed limited ecotypic differences in current suitability and range expansion under climate change through the rest of this century. We also predicted climatic suitability for Johnsongrass to increase most in the Upper Midwest and Great Plains by 2100. Our results help contextualize the empirical evidence for ecotypic differentiation in Johnsongrass, as well predict future range expansion and damage niches.","[Lakoba, Vasiliy T.] Virginia Tech, Sch Plant & Environm Sci, 675 Old Glade Rd, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Atwater, Daniel Z.] Earlham Coll, Dept Biol, 801 Natl Rd, Richmond, IN 47374 USA; [Thomas, Valerie E.; Strahm, Brian D.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, 310 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Barney, Jacob N.] Virginia Tech, Sch Plant & Environm Sci, 1015 Life Sci Circle, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Lakoba, Vasiliy T.] 27234 Alpine Dr, Abingdon, VA 24211 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Earlham College; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lakoba, VT (corresponding author), 29010 Hawthorne Dr, Meadowview, VA 24361 USA.",vtlakoba@vt.edu; atwatda@earlham.edu; thomasv@vt.edu; brian.strahm@vt.edu; jnbarney@vt.edu,,"Thomas, Valerie/0000-0003-2189-6013",Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; National Institute of Food and Agriculture Global Food Security CAP [2015-68004-493 23492],Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; National Institute of Food and Agriculture Global Food Security CAP,This work was partially supported by the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture Global Food Security CAP [2015-68004-493 23492 to JNB].,,101,3,3,7,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2351-9894,,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Competition theory predicts that community structure may be shaped by resource partitioning between co-occurring species. As such, quantifying the degree of resource partitioning (i.e., niche overlap) is a key component of studies examining community structure and species coexistence. 2. For many organisms, multiple resource axes quantify niche space. Each axis may be described by a different type of data (e.g. categorical, continuous, count or binary data, as well as electivity scores), with different data types requiring different statistical treatments. Therefore, incorporating multiple axes into a single measure of niche space is problematic. 3. Here, we propose general methods for combining multiple niche axes, each characterized by different data types, within a unified analysis of niche overlap. Using appropriate transformations and probability models, we show that each data type can give rise to directly comparable measures of niche overlap, with the overlap statistic between two species defined as the overlapping area between the distributions for each species. 4. Measurements derived from different types of data can be combined into a single unified analysis of niche overlap by averaging over multiple axes. 5. We then describe null model permutation tests that assess statistical differences in niche overlap, which can address questions commonly posed by population ecologists (e.g. do two species occupy different niche space?) and community ecologists (e.g. are multiple species evenly distributed across niche space?). 6. To illustrate the use of these newly devised indices, we use an example from reef fishes that combines ratio, categorical and electivity data, and an example from alpine plants that combines continuous and ratio data. 7. The methods described in this article are relevant to a wide variety of ecological projects, including the investigation of invasive species, relative abundance distributions, global change, species coexistence and evolutionary diversification.","[Geange, Shane W.; Burns, Kevin C.; Shima, Jeffrey S.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Pledger, Shirley] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Math Stat & Operat Res, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Geange, SW (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",shane.geange@vuw.ac.nz,"Shima, Jeffrey/AAH-3702-2021","Shima, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5770-4859; Burns, K.C./0000-0002-4938-2877; Geange, Shane/0000-0002-0679-0272",NSF [OCE-0242312]; VUW,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); VUW,"Phil Lester, Richard Taylor and Geoff Jones provided many helpful comments on versions of this manuscript.

Approaches analyzing the functional (or phylogenetic) similarity between invasive species and native communities are increasingly employed to infer the processes underlying successful invasions and to predict future invaders. The relatively simple conceptual foundations have made these approaches very appealing and therefore widely used, often leading to confusion and hampering generalizations. We undertook a comprehensive review and synthesis of the functional similarity approach in invasion community ecology to clarify its advantages and limitations, to summarize what has been learned thus far, and to suggest avenues for future improvement. We first present the methodological state of the art and provide general guidelines. Second, by organizing the published literature around seven key questions in invasion ecology we found cumulative evidence that: at large spatial scales phylogenetic relatedness of invasive and native species is a good predictor of invasion success, but a poor predictor of invasion impacts; at fine spatial scales, community resistance to invasion tends to increase with native species diversity and with similarity to the invaders, consistent with patterns emerging from biotic interactions. In general, the processes filtering invaders appear to vary across species' invasion stage and along environmental gradients. Nonetheless, we found conflicting evidence for differences in community assembly processes between invasive and native species, and between the invader's native and adventive ranges. Finally, we propose four important avenues for overcoming some of the identified methodological and conceptual limitations of the approach, in particular by integrating observational and experimental analyses and by explicitly considering species' demographic rates and complex biotic interactions. Although the functional similarity approach bears intrinsic limitations, it still offers many opportunities in invasion community ecology at large spatial scales.","[Gallien, Laure] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Carboni, Marta] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Laboratoire Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Carboni, Marta] CNRS, Laboratoire EcoleAlpine LECA, Grenoble, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Gallien, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",laure.gallien@gmail.com,"Carboni, Marta/A-2658-2012","Carboni, Marta/0000-0002-9348-4758",European Commission [IASIMOV 327616]; ERA-Net BiodivERsA; ANR [ANR-13-EBID-0004]; DFG; FWF,European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); ERA-Net BiodivERsA; ANR(French National Research Agency (ANR)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We are very grateful to Tamara Munkemuller and Wilfried Thuiller who provided constructive comments to this manuscript.

The results of a revisitation study after c. 34years of 89 coastal sites in Scotland, UK, were examined to assess the degree of shifts in species composition that could be accounted for by climate change. There was little evidence for either species retreat northwards or for plots to become more dominated by species with a more southern distribution. At a few sites where significant change occurred, the changes were accounted for by the invasion, or in one instance the removal, of woody species. Also, the vegetation types that showed the most sensitivity to change were all early successional types and changes were primarily the result of succession rather than climate-driven changes. Dune vegetation appears resistant to climate change impacts on the vegetation, either as the vegetation is inherently resistant to change, management prevents increased dominance of more southerly species or because of dispersal limitation to geographically isolated sites.","[Pakeman, Robin J.; Alexander, Jim; Beaton, Joan; Brooker, Rob; Cummins, Roger; Eastwood, Antonia; Fielding, Debbie; Fisher, Julia; Gore, Sarah; Hewison, Richard; Hooper, Russell; Mitchell, Ruth; Nolan, Andrew; Pemberton, Clare; Riach, Dave; Sim, Dave; Stockan, Jenni] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Lennon, Jack] Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Moore, Emily] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Ashworth Labs, Edinburgh EH9 3FL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Orford, Katy] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Trinder, Clare] Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UL, Scotland; [Lewis, Rob] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Ecoinformat & Biodivers, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",James Hutton Institute; University of Edinburgh; University of Bristol; University of Aberdeen; Aarhus University,"Pakeman, RJ (corresponding author), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk,"Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015; Mitchell, Ruth/F-4159-2010","Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133; Mitchell, Ruth/0000-0001-8151-2769",Esmee Fairbairn Foundation; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division,Esmee Fairbairn Foundation; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division,The resurvey would not have been possible without the many landowners/managers who gave their access permission and the many agency staff and others who facilitated this.

The idea is that the opportunity for new species to enter a community (its invasibility) determines the present richness of that community as well as the long-term build-up of a species pool by speciation and migration. We propose that a community's invasibility is determined by the turnover rate of reproductive genets in the community, which we call the 'community-level birth rate'. The faster the turn-over, the more species will accumulate per unit time and per unit community size (number of genets) at a given per-birth rate of immigration and speciation. Spatially discrete communities inhabiting similar environments sum up to metacommunities, whose inhabitant species constitute the regional species pool. We propose that the size of a regional species pool is determined by the aggregate community-level birth rate, the size of the metacommunity through time and age of the metacommunity. Thus, the novel contribution is our proposal of a direct effect of local environment on the build-up rate of species pools. The relative importance of immigrating species and neospecies originating locally will change with the temporal and spatial scale under consideration. We propose that the diversification rate specific to evolutionary lineages and the build-up rate of species pools are two sides of the same coin, and that they are both depending on mean generation time. The proposed model offers a reconciliation of two contrasting paradigms in current community ecology, viz. one focussing on present-time ecological processes and one focussing on historical events governing the size of species pools which in turn determines local richness.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Univ Copenhagen, Arctic Stn, Qeqertarsuaq 3953, Greenland",Lund University,"Bruun, HH (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",hans_henrik.bruun@ekol.lu.se,"Ejrnæs, Rasmus/K-7070-2013; Bruun, Hans Henrik/C-4476-2008","Bruun, Hans Henrik/0000-0003-0674-2577; Ejrnaes, Rasmus/0000-0003-2538-8606",,,,,81,20,21,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2006,113,1,,,,,185,191,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2001.14174.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2001.14174.x,,,7,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,013OK,,Green Submitted,,,2023-03-22,WOS:000235418400018,View Full Record in Web of Science
