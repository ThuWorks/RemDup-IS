Leaf Functional Traits in Relation to Species Composition in an Arctic–Alpine Tundra Grassland,"The relict arctic–alpine tundra provides a natural laboratory to study the potential impacts of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on tundra vegetation. The Nardus stricta -dominated relict tundra grasslands in the Krkonoše Mountains have experienced shifting species dynamics over the past few decades. Changes in species cover of the four competing grasses— Nardus stricta , Calamagrostis villosa , Molinia caerulea , and Deschampsia cespitosa —were successfully detected using orthophotos. Leaf functional traits (anatomy/morphology, element accumulation, leaf pigments, and phenolic compound profiles) , were examined in combination with in situ chlorophyll fluorescence in order to shed light on their respective spatial expansions and retreats. Our results suggest a diverse phenolic profile in combination with early leaf expansion and pigment accumulation has aided the expansion of C. villosa , while microhabitats may drive the expansion and decline of D. cespitosa in different areas of the grassland. N. stricta —the dominant species—is retreating, while M. caerulea did not demonstrate significant changes in territory between 2012 and 2018. We propose that the seasonal dynamics of pigment accumulation and canopy formation are important factors when assessing potential “spreader” species and recommend that phenology be taken into account when monitoring grass species using remote sensing.",2785207628,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Viničná 5, 12844 Prague, Czech Republic , Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Viničná 5, 12844 Prague, Czech Republic , Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Viničná 5, 12844 Prague, Czech Republic , Global Change Research Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences, Bělidla 4a, 60300 Brno, Czech Republic , Global Change Research Institute, Czech Academy of Sciences, Bělidla 4a, 60300 Brno, Czech Republic , Department of Applied Geoinformatics and Cartography, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 6, 12800 Prague, Czech Republic , Department of Applied Geoinformatics and Cartography, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Albertov 6, 12800 Prague, Czech Republic , Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904, USA , Goddard Earth Science Technology and Research (GESTAR) II, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA; Biospheric Sciences Laboratory, Building 33, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA , Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Viničná 5, 12844 Prague, Czech Republic","Hunt, Lena;Lhotáková, Zuzana;Neuwirthová, Eva;Klem, Karel;Oravec, Michal;Kupková, Lucie;Červená, Lucie;Epstein, Howard E;Campbell, Petya;Albrechtová, Jana"," © 2023 by the authors.

"Resistance of Lichens and Mosses of Regenerated Alpine Communities to Repeated Experimental Trampling in the Belianske Tatras, Northern Slovakia","Due to the destruction of alpine ecosystems by extreme human trampling, some alpine areas are closed to tourists. After years of regeneration, a tendency toward reopening these areas for tourism is envisaged. Although numerous studies have documented vegetative responses to trampling disturbance, research that thoroughly examines the trampling impacts on the vegetation at different organizational levels is often limited. Most of the previous studies on the human disturbance of vegetation focused on the impacts on vascular plants, while the impacts on lichens or mosses are less well-documented. To understand how regenerated communities respond to further trampling disturbance, we repeated the experimental research on short-term trampling after 14 years in three high-altitude communities in the Tatras in northern Slovakia. According to Cole and Bayfield’s protocol, we evaluated the resistance of communities trampled in 2008 and 2022, with a focus on groups of lichens and mosses and their individual species. This research brings new knowledge regarding the different behaviors of regenerated vegetation, especially lichens and mosses, to trampling disturbance. The results show that human trampling in alpine communities has a large negative impact and, therefore, management plans should discourage off-trail hiking and limit recreational activities in sensitive or reopened alpine areas.",2779474202,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Landscape Ecology of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Akademická 2, 949 10 Nitra, Slovakia , Department of Ecological and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Informatics, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Trieda A.

"<i>Alchemilla monticola</i> Opiz. Functional Traits Respond to Diverse Alpine Environmental Conditions in Karavanke, Slovenia","Alpine plants are exposed to demanding environmental conditions, such as high ultraviolet (UV) and photosynthetic radiation, extreme temperatures, drought, and nutrient deficiencies. Alpine plants adapt and acclimate to harsh conditions, developing several strategies, including biochemical, physiological, and optical responses. However, alpine plants’ survival strategies are hardly researched due to time-consuming and complex experimental conditions, which are supported by scarce studies. Our study focused on the functional traits of the alpine plant Alchemilla monticola Opiz (hairy lady’s mantle) growing at two different altitudes (1500, 2000 m a.s.l.) and two different UV exposures per altitude. Near-ambient (UV) and reduced (UV-) UV radiations were provided by using two sorts of UV absorbing filters; temperatures were monitored hourly. The experimental plots were located at Tegoška Gora, Karavanke, Slovenia. Functional traits: physiological, biochemical, and optical characteristics were recorded three times during the growing season. A. monticola showed high maximum photochemical efficiency at both altitudes throughout the season, which confirms good adaptation and acclimatization of the plant. Furthermore, significantly higher maximum photochemical efficiency at the subalpine altitude coincided with significantly higher UV absorbing compounds (UV AC) contents at the subalpine compared to the montane altitude in August. A. monticola manifested high UV AC contents throughout the season, with significantly increased synthesis of UV AC contents in the subalpine conditions in August and September. The stomatal conductance rate increased with altitude and was correlated mostly to a lower temperature. A. monticola leaves did not transmit any UV spectrum, which corresponded to high total UV AC contents. The leaf transmittance of the photosynthetic spectrum increased at the subalpine altitude, while the transmittance of the green and yellow spectra increased under the reduced UV radiation in the autumn. A. monticola ’s high photosynthetic spectrum transmittance at the subalpine altitude in the autumn might therefore be due to subalpine harsh environmental conditions, as well as plant ontogenetical phase.",2724283640,,Scholarly Journals,,"Sedej, Tadeja Trošt;Turk, Tajda"," © 2022 by the authors.

"The Relationships of Habitat Conditions, Height Level, and Geographical Position with Fruit and Seed Traits in Populations of Invasive Vine <i>Echinocystis lobata</i> (Cucurbitaceae) in Central and Eastern Europe","In climbing plants, fruits can be formed at different heights, depending on the height of external support. However, the effect of height on fruit and seed traits in invasive vines of Cucurbitaceae has not been intensively studied so far. In Europe, Echinocystis lobata , a North American member of Cucurbitaceae, is considered one of the most abundant invasive alien plants spreading in natural riparian forests, thickets, and tall herbs, whereas it is a rare species in urban woodlands. In this study, we tested the variability of selected fruit and seed traits of E . lobata in connection with habitat origin (natural, semi-natural, and anthropogenic), habitat type (using the EUNIS habitat classification), height (the distance between the fruit and the ground), and geographical position. The study was conducted in 2018 in 65 sites located in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. In each study site, a random sample of 10 fresh mature fruits of E. lobata was collected from subsequent 0.50 m intervals of height. The length, the width, and the weight of the fresh fruits, as well as the total number of seeds and number of undeveloped seeds per fruit, were examined. Moreover, the well-developed seeds from selected study sites were weighed. The statistical analysis showed the significant effect of habitat origin, habitat type, and height on most of the studied fruit and seed traits. The largest range of height (from 0.00 to 4.00 m) was observed in two types of habitats (F—heathland, scrub, and tundra; and G—woodland, forest, and other wooded land). The total number of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with the length, width, and weight of the fresh fruits. The fruits were a little heavier and bigger in natural habitats located in the northeast of the study area. The distribution of fruits at different heights may contribute to better dispersal of seeds by animals and wind, and may also better protect the seeds from being eaten by granivorous animals. The defence against seed-eating animals is expected to be stronger in semi-natural habitats, as well as on banks and shores of inland surface waters, where the seed production is the highest. The influence of seed traits on seed germination and seedling survival in various habitats and their importance in the invasiveness of E . lobata require further study.",2632735759,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Tourism Geography and Ecology, Institute of Tourism, Faculty of Tourism and Recreation, University of Physical Education in Cracow, 31-571 Kraków, Poland , Department of Taxonomy, Phytogeography and Palaeobotany, Institute of Botany, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 3, 30-387 Kraków, Poland; <email>artur.pliszko@uj.edu.pl</email> , Department of Botany, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, Pedagogical University of Cracow, Podchorążych 2, 30-084 Kraków, Poland; <email>beata.barabasz-krasny@up.krakow.pl</email> , Department of Geobotany and Plant Ecology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Łódź, Poland; <email>anna.bomanowska@biol.uni.lodz.pl</email> , Department of Botany, Institute of Environmental Biology, University of Wrocław, Kanonia 6/8, 50-328 Wrocław, Poland; <email>zygmunt.dajdok@uwr.edu.pl</email> (Z.D.); <email>jakub.majk@gmail.com</email> (J.M.); <email>ewa.szczesniak@uwr.edu.pl</email> (E.S.) , Nature Research Centre, Laboratory of Flora and Geobotany, Institute of Botany, Žaliųjų Ežerų 49, 12000 Vilnius, Lithuania; <email>zigmantas.gudzinskas@gamtc.lt</email> , Department of Zoology and Nature Conservation, Institute of Biological Sciences, Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, 20-033 Lublin, Poland; <email>marek.kucharczyk@mail.umcs.pl</email> , Kowalewo 6, 64-061 Kamieniec, Poland; <email>lukaszmackowiak123@gmail.com</email> , Department of Botany, Institute of Environmental Biology, University of Wrocław, Kanonia 6/8, 50-328 Wrocław, Poland; <email>zygmunt.dajdok@uwr.edu.pl</email> (Z.D.); <email>jakub.majk@gmail.com</email> (J.M.); <email>ewa.szczesniak@uwr.edu.pl</email> (E.S.) , Department of Plant Physiology, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, Pedagogical University of Cracow, Podchorążych 2, 30-084 Kraków, Poland; <email>katarzyna.mozdzen@up.krakow.pl</email> , Department of Environmental Biology, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Uniwersytecka 7, 25-406 Kielce, Poland; <email>monika.podgorska@ujk.edu.pl</email> , Life Science Centre, Institute of Biosciences, Vilnius University, Saulėtekio Av. 7, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; <email>mindaugas.rasimavicius@gf.vu.lt</email> , Department of Biogeography, Paleoecology and Nature Conservation, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Banacha 1/3, 90-237 Łódź, Poland; <email>agnieszka.rewicz@biol.uni.lodz.pl</email> , Department of Botany, Institute of Environmental Biology, University of Wrocław, Kanonia 6/8, 50-328 Wrocław, Poland; <email>zygmunt.dajdok@uwr.edu.pl</email> (Z.D.); <email>jakub.majk@gmail.com</email> (J.M.); <email>ewa.szczesniak@uwr.edu.pl</email> (E.S.) , Department of Nature Conservation and Landscape Ecology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Land Management and Environmental Protection, University of Rzeszów, Zelwerowicza 4, 35-601 Rzeszów, Poland; <email>twojcik@ur.edu.pl</email> , Department of Plant Ecology, Institute of Botany, Jagiellonian University, Gronostajowa 3, 30-387 Kraków, Poland; <email>alina.stachurska-swakon@uj.edu.pl</email>","Kostrakiewicz-Gierałt, Kinga;Pliszko, Artur;Barabasz-Krasny, Beata;Bomanowska, Anna;Dajdok, Zygmunt;Gudžinskas, Zigmantas;Kucharczyk, Marek;Maćkowiak, Łukasz;Majk, Jakub;Możdżeń, Katarzyna;Podgórska, Monika;Rasimavičius, Mindaugas;Rewicz, Agnieszka;Szczęśniak, Ewa;Wójcik, Tomasz;Stachurska-Swakoń, Alina"," © 2022 by the authors.

Trait-based responses to cessation of nutrient enrichment in a tundra plant community,"Plant communities worldwide show varied responses to nutrient enrichment—including shifts in species identity, decreased diversity, and changes in functional trait composition—but the factors determining community recovery after the cessation of nutrient addition remain uncertain. We manipulated nutrient levels in a tundra community for 6&#xa0;years of nutrient addition followed by 8&#xa0;years of recovery. We examined how community recovery was mediated by traits related to plant resource-use strategy and plant ability to modify their environment. Overall, we observed persistent effects of fertilization on plant communities. We found that plants with fast-growing traits, including higher specific leaf area, taller stature and lower foliar C:N, were more likely to show a persistent increase in fertilized plots than control plots, maintaining significantly higher cover in fertilized plots 8&#xa0;years after cessation of fertilization. Additionally, although graminoids responded most strongly to the initial fertilization treatment, forb species were more vulnerable to fertilization effects in the long-term, showing persistent decline and no recovery in 8&#xa0;years. Finally, these persistent fertilization effects were accompanied by modified environmental conditions, including persistent increases in litter depth and soil phosphorous and lower soil C:N. Our results demonstrate the potential for lasting effects of nutrient enrichment in nutrient-limited systems and identify species traits related to rapid growth and nutrient-use efficiency as the main predictors of the persistence of nutrient enrichment effects.

Shrub growth in the Alps diverges from air temperature since the 1990s,"In the European Alps, air temperature has increased almost twice as much as the global average over the last century and, as a corollary, snow cover duration has decreased substantially. In the Arctic, dendroecological studies have evidenced that shrub growth is highly sensitive to temperature—this phenomenon has often been linked to shrub expansion and ecosystem greening. Yet, the impacts of climate change on mountain shrub radial growth have not been studied with a comparable level of detail so far. Moreover, dendroecological studies performed in mountain environments did not account for the potential modulation and/or buffering of global warming impacts by topography, despite its possible crucial role in complex alpine environments. To fill this gap, we analyzed a network of eight sites dominated by the dwarf shrub Rhododendron ferrugineum . The sites selected for analysis represent the diversity of continentality, elevation and slope aspect that can be found across the French Alps. We quantified annual radial increment growth for 119 individuals, assembled meteorological reanalyzes specifically accounting for topographic effects (elevation, slope and aspect) and assessed climate-growth relations using a mixed modeling approach. In agreement with a vast majority of dendroecological work conducted in alpine and arctic environments, we find that the number of growing degree days during the snow-free period snow-free growing degree days (SFGDDs) is a strong and consistent driver of R. ferrugineum growth across all sites since 1960 until the late 1980s. We also document a marked loss of sensitivity of radial growth to increasing SFGDD since the 1990s, with this decoupling being more pronounced at the driest sites. Our observations of the spatial and temporal variability of shrub sensitivity to limiting factors can be compared to the ‘divergence’ problem observed in tree-ring series from circumpolar and alpine regions and, accordingly, sheds light on possible future trajectories of alpine shrub growth in response to ongoing climate change.",2548697510,,Scholarly Journals," Climate Change Impacts and Risks in the Anthropocene (C-CIA), Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Université Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Geolab, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France , Climate Change Impacts and Risks in the Anthropocene (C-CIA), Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Université Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Geolab, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France , Université Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Geolab, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France , Université Grenoble Alpes, Université Savoie Mont-Blanc, CNRS, LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France , Université Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, Geolab, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France , Centre de Recherches sur les Ecosystèmes d’Altitude (CREA), Observatoire du Mont-Blanc, 74400 Chamonix, France , Université Grenoble Alpes, Université de Toulouse, Météo-France, CNRS, CNRM, Centre d’Études de la Neige, 38000 Grenoble, France , Université Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, PIAF, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France , Climate Change Impacts and Risks in the Anthropocene (C-CIA), Institute for Environmental Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Department of Earth Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Department F.-A.

Decreased soil moisture due to warming drives phylogenetic diversity and community transitions in the tundra,"Global warming leads to drastic changes in the diversity and structure of Arctic plant communities. Studies of functional diversity within the Arctic tundra biome have improved our understanding of plant responses to warming. However, these studies still show substantial unexplained variation in diversity responses. Complementary to functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity has been useful in climate change studies, but has so far been understudied in the Arctic. Here, we use a 25 year warming experiment to disentangle community responses in Arctic plant phylogenetic β diversity across a soil moisture gradient. We found that responses varied over the soil moisture gradient, where meadow communities with intermediate to high soil moisture had a higher magnitude of response. Warming had a negative effect on soil moisture levels in all meadow communities, however meadows with intermediate moisture levels were more sensitive. In these communities, soil moisture loss was associated with earlier snowmelt, resulting in community turnover towards a more heath-like community. This process of ‘heathification’ in the intermediate moisture meadows was driven by the expansion of ericoid and Betula shrubs. In contrast, under a more consistent water supply Salix shrub abundance increased in wet meadows. Due to its lower stature, palatability and decomposability, the increase in heath relative to meadow vegetation can have several large scale effects on the local food web as well as climate. Our study highlights the importance of the hydrological cycle as a driver of vegetation turnover in response to Arctic climate change. The observed patterns in phylogenetic β diversity were often driven by contrasting responses of species of the same functional growth form, and could thus provide important complementary information. Thus, phylogenetic diversity is an important tool in disentangling tundra response to environmental change.",2535686017,,Scholarly Journals," Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Earth Sciences, University of Gothenburg, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , School of Environmental Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada , Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 461, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , Environmental Science Center, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar , Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 461, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, TW9 3AE, Richmond, Surrey, United Kingdom; Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, OX1 3RB Oxford, United Kingdom , Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Earth Sciences, University of Gothenburg, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 461, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 461, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Earth Sciences, University of Gothenburg, SE-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden","Scharn, Ruud;Little, Chelsea J;Bacon, Christine D;Alatalo, Juha M;Antonelli, Alexandre;Björkman, Mats P;Molau, Ulf;Nilsson, R Henrik;Björk, Robert G"," © 2021.

"Multiscale mapping of plant functional groups and plant traits in the High Arctic using field spectroscopy, UAV imagery and Sentinel-2A data","The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, leading to rapid changes in species composition and plant functional trait variation. Landscape-level maps of vegetation composition and trait distributions are required to expand spatially-limited plot studies, overcome sampling biases associated with the most accessible research areas, and create baselines from which to monitor environmental change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a low-cost method to generate high-resolution imagery and bridge the gap between fine-scale field studies and lower resolution satellite analyses. Here we used field spectroscopy data (400–2500 nm) and UAV multispectral imagery to test spectral methods of species identification and plant water and chemistry retrieval near Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Using the field spectroscopy data and Random Forest analysis, we were able to distinguish eight common High Arctic plant tundra species with 74% accuracy. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we were able to predict corresponding water, nitrogen, phosphorus and C:N values ( r 2 = 0.61–0.88, RMSEmean = 12%–64%). We developed analogous models using UAV imagery (five bands: Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge and Near-Infrared) and scaled up the results across a 450 m long nutrient gradient located underneath a seabird colony. At the UAV level, we were able to map three plant functional groups (mosses, graminoids and dwarf shrubs) at 72% accuracy and generate maps of plant chemistry. Our maps show a clear marine-derived fertility gradient, mediated by geomorphology. We used the UAV results to explore two methods of upscaling plant water content to the wider landscape using Sentinel-2A imagery. Our results are pertinent for high resolution, low-cost mapping of the Arctic.",2518767923,,Scholarly Journals," School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom , School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom , Department of Biological Sciences and Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway , Matanuska-Susitna College, University of Alaska, Anchorage, AK, United States of America , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America , Department of Biological Sciences and Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway , Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States of America , Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; Arctic Biology, The University Centre in Svalbard, Longyearbyen, Norway , Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Aas Norway , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America; Institute of Ecology and Key Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes of the Ministry of Education, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, People’s Republic of China , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America , Department of Botany and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada , Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland , Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Aas Norway , Department of Biological Sciences and Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States of America , Department of Biological Sciences and Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway , School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom , School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Thomson, Eleanor R;Spiegel, Marcus P;Althuizen, Inge H J;Bass, Polly;Chen, Shuli;Chmurzynski, Adam;Halbritter, Aud H;Henn, Jonathan J;Jónsdóttir, Ingibjörg S;Klanderud, Kari;Li, Yaoqi;Maitner, Brian S;Michaletz, Sean T;Niittynen, Pekka;Roos, Ruben E;Telford, Richard J;Enquist, Brian J;Vandvik, Vigdis;Macias-Fauria, Marc;Malhi, Yadvinder"," © 2021.

Warming matters: alpine plant responses to experimental warming,"Climate change has pronounced impacts on plants, particularly in environments vulnerable to warming such as alpine zones. Although plant responses in tundra and alpine environments from high latitudes have been well-studied at the community level, the overall effect of warming on global alpine plant populations and species remains unclear. We collated global data from 46 open-top chamber (OTC) studies conducted on alpine plants from mountain belts worldwide and assessed potential effects of warming on plant performance. In addition, we examined warming responses of plants from the tundra zone (Arctic tundra and alpine tundra) in circumpolar regions. In terms of growth and reproductive output, the overall response of 91 plant species was highly positive. Shrubs grew significantly larger and expressed higher reproduction under warming compared to forbs and graminoids. Arctic tundra plants tended to respond more positively to warming compared to alpine tundra plants. We also found that plant responses were greater with increasing precipitation across circumpolar tundra, but not across alpine zones. Phenotypic plasticity in size- and fitness-related traits were similar for both alpine and tundra zones. Our findings support the notion that global warming can cause significant changes to alpine environments. Due to changes in biotic interactions, alpine tundra plants may be more negatively affected by warming compared to Arctic tundra plants which responded more positively to warming. Similarly, if shrubs are most advantaged under warming, their invasion into higher elevations may threaten the ecological functioning of alpine ecosystems, which is another serious challenge from climate change.",2492800075,,Scholarly Journals," Ordu University, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Ordu, Turkey (GRID:grid.412366.4) (ISNI:0000 0004 0399 5963) , Jiangsu University, Institute of Environment and Ecology, School of the Environment and Safety Engineering, Zhenjiang, China (GRID:grid.440785.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 0743 511X)",Fazlioglu Fatih;Wan Justin S H," © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature 2021.

Climate-Change Impacts on the Southernmost Mediterranean Arctic-Alpine Plant Populations,"Human-induced climate- and land-use change have been affecting biogeographical and biodiversity patterns for the past two centuries all over the globe, resulting in increased extinction and biotic homogenization rates. High mountain ecosystems are more sensitive to these changes, which have led to physiological and phenological shifts, as well as to ecosystem processes’ deformation. Glacial relicts, such as arctic-alpine taxa, are sensitive indicators of the effects of global warming and their rear-edge populations could include warm-adapted genotypes that might prove—conservation-wise—useful in an era of unprecedented climate regimes. Despite the ongoing thermophilization in European and Mediterranean summits, it still remains unknown how past and future climate-change might affect the distributional patterns of the glacial relict, arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece, their European southernmost distributional limit. Using species distribution models, we investigated the impacts of past and future climate changes on the arctic-alpine taxa occurring in Greece and identified the areas comprising arctic-alpine biodiversity hotspots in Greece. Most of these species will be faced with severe range reductions in the near future, despite their innate resilience to a multitude of threats, while the species richness hotspots will experience both altitudinal and latitudinal shifts. Being long-lived perennials means that there might be an extinction-debt present in these taxa, and a prolonged stability phase could be masking the deleterious effects of climate change on them.

Climate Warming Persistence Triggered Tree Ingression After Shrub Encroachment in a High Alpine Tundra,"Climate warming can induce the encroachment of shrubs and may trigger treeline dynamics. However, the responses of shrubs and trees to climate change may be modulated by other environmental drivers such as land-use change and biological interactions. The European Alps are one of the three areas experiencing the most intense warming globally in the twentieth century. We analyse, through a multidisciplinary approach, the shrub and tree encroachment at the Stelvio Pass (Italian Alps) focusing on three target species ( Rhododendron ferrugineum, Larix decidua, Pinus mugo ) to reconstruct their dynamics and assess which drivers (climate change, land-use change, biological interactions provided by shrub facilitation) promoted their ingression. Shrub colonization started in 1867, in coincidence with the end of the Little Ice Age. Tree recruitment started since 1960 for P. mugo and 1972 for L. decidua and correlated strongly with air warming and shortening of the snow cover duration. Climate (air temperature, snow cover) exhibited the highest correlation with shrub and tree dynamics both during the period of recruitment and in the following and preceding 5-year period. Air warming appeared to be crucial for tree ingression and persistence. Land-use change was not related to shrub encroachment, and only weakly to tree recruitment. Both the correlation analysis as well as the patterns of recruitment highlighted that shrubs were characterized by different ecological requirements from trees. There was not a “nurse effect” of shrubs on trees, and this biotic interaction changed with the developmental stage of the involved species, being lowest for seedlings and highest for adults, requiring further investigations. Future scenarios of climate change indicate a further and intense warming, and our data show that it is likely that shrub and tree encroachment will proceed, with relevant consequences on the extremely vulnerable high-elevation alpine ecosystems.",2473381502,,Scholarly Journals," Insubria University, Department Theoretical and Applied Sciences, Varese, Italy (GRID:grid.18147.3b) (ISNI:0000000121724807) , Insubria University, Department Science and High Technology, Como, Italy (GRID:grid.18147.3b) (ISNI:0000000121724807)",Malfasi Francesco;Cannone Nicoletta," © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Decadal dynamics of dry alpine meadows under nitrogen and phosphorus additions,"Plants often exhibit positive responses to multiple nutrient additions, but generalities about the life form and traits of the most responsive species are few. Findings from long-term experiments in dry meadow alpine tundra in Colorado, USA, were used here to examine univariate and multivariate analyses of plant and plant trait responses. We found transient responses for community richness–biomass relationships, but a consistent increase in forb dominance in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition plots. The response seen in the N + P plots was not affected by additions of micronutrients or potassium. Multivariate analyses corroborate transient responses in community shifts over shorter-time scales, and directional shifts in N + P over two decades. Using species-level aboveground trait data when available, we found N + P may favor species with resource-acquisitive traits, regardless of their lifeform, as well as relatively tall grasses, regardless of their resource strategy. In the absence of N and P limitation but with the environmental constraints found in dry alpine meadows, plant richness and community structure continued to exhibit transient states for decadal time frames.",2418897081,,Scholarly Journals," University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564) , US Forest Service Northern Research Station, Houghton, USA (GRID:grid.472551.0) (ISNI:0000 0004 0404 3120) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); Dartmouth College, Department of Biology, Hanover, USA (GRID:grid.254880.3) (ISNI:0000 0001 2179 2404) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); St. Edward’s University, Program in Environmental Science and Policy, Austin, USA (GRID:grid.264052.7) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); University of Massachusetts, Department of Environmental Conservation, Amherst, USA (GRID:grid.266683.f) (ISNI:0000 0001 2184 9220) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564)","Seastedt, T R;White, C T;Tucker, C;Beaury, E M;Concilio, A L;Gasarch, E I;Haggans, V J;Smith, J G", © Springer Nature B.V. 2020. ,10.1007/s11258-020-01039-8, Journal Article, 2020-05-29, Aug 2020,1385-0237,8, English, English, 647-658, Dordrecht,Aug 2020,Plant Ecology,2020,221,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/decadal-dynamics-dry-alpine-meadows-under/docview/2418897081/se-2?accountid=12870,," Alpine , Community dynamics , Graminoids , Forbs , Nitrogen , Phosphorus"," 2020-05-21 (Registration) , 2019-12-04 (Received) , 2020-05-21 (Accepted)", 647,," Plant communities , Species , Phosphorus , Nitrogen , Tundra , Community structure , Community structure , Phosphorus , Tundra , Micronutrients , Phosphorus , Nitrogen , Potassium , Micronutrients , Multivariate analysis , Meadows , Meadows , Transient response , Tundra"," Alpine , Community dynamics , Graminoids , Forbs , Nitrogen , Phosphorus",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aagriculturejournals&amp;atitle=Decadal+dynamics+of+dry+alpine+meadows+under+nitrogen+and+phosphorus+additions&amp;title=Plant+Ecology&amp;issn=13850237&amp;date=2020-08-01&amp;volume=221&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=647&amp;au=Seastedt%2C+T+R%3BWhite%2C+C+T%3BTucker%2C+C%3BBeaury%2C+E+M%3BConcilio%2C+A+L%3BGasarch%2C+E+I%3BHaggans%2C+V+J%3BSmith%2C+J+G&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Plant+Ecology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11258-020-01039-8,SciTech Premium Collection
"Testing invasion filters for the alpine: the roles of temperature, nitrogen deposition and soil","Alpine areas will likely experience an increase in non-native plant species invasions. Increased human activity and environmental changes are expected to lower the environmental constraints for their establishment and spread. To understand and prepare for high elevation plant invasions it is necessary to evaluate the changes in environmental factors that make alpine regions susceptible to potential invaders. The alpine of the Rocky Mountains has very few occurrences of non-native species to date, but anthropogenic environmental changes may facilitate invasion. We tested whether Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass or downy brome) invasion in the Rocky Mountain alpine could be facilitated by increases in mean and minimum growing season temperatures. We also tested whether nitrogen (N) deposition and alpine soil may modify B. tectorum ’s responses to climate warming. Our findings suggest that alpine soils inhibited growth of B. tectorum regardless of temperature or simulated N deposition. These results indicate that local alpine invasion by B. tectorum is unlikely in the near future. However, higher minimum growing temperatures and increased N addition did enhance B. tectorum growth for plants grown in upper montane soils. Such changes may promote population growth of B. tectorum within montane elevations.",2399630896,,Scholarly Journals," University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); University of Colorado, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); University of Colorado, Mountain Research Station, Nederland, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) , University of Colorado, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); University of Colorado, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, Boulder, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a) (ISNI:0000000096214564); University of Colorado, Mountain Research Station, Nederland, USA (GRID:grid.266190.a)","Potter, Teal S;Bowman, William D", © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020. ,10.1007/s10530-020-02225-5, Journal Article, 2020-03-11, Jun 2020,1387-3547,6, English, English, 1889-1901, Dordrecht,Jun 2020,Biological Invasions,2020,22,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/testing-invasion-filters-alpine-roles-temperature/docview/2399630896/se-2?accountid=12870,," Cheatgrass , Bromus tectorum , Alpine , Invasion filters , Freeze , Soil"," 2020-02-17 (Registration) , 2017-12-26 (Received) , 2020-02-17 (Accepted)", 1889,," Invasions , Invasive species , Global warming , Invasive species , Deposition , Anthropogenic factors , Indigenous species , Elevation , Nitrogen , Temperature , Introduced species , Soil temperature , Environmental changes , Climate change , Invasions , Human influences , Mountains , Indigenous plants , Population growth , Soils , Nitrogen , Deposition , Environmental changes , Soils , Alpine environments , Indigenous species , Mountains , Introduced species , Population growth , Alpine regions , Environmental factors , Population growth , Environmental factors , Bromus tectorum"," Cheatgrass , Bromus tectorum , Alpine , Invasion filters , Freeze , Soil",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Abiologicalscijournals&amp;atitle=Testing+invasion+filters+for+the+alpine%3A+the+roles+of+temperature%2C+nitrogen+deposition+and+soil&amp;title=Biological+Invasions&amp;issn=13873547&amp;date=2020-06-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1889&amp;au=Potter%2C+Teal+S%3BBowman%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Biological+Invasions&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10530-020-02225-5,SciTech Premium Collection
Status and trends of tundra birds across the circumpolar Arctic,"Tundra-breeding birds face diverse conservation challenges, from accelerated rates of Arctic climate change to threats associated with highly migratory life histories. Here we summarise the status and trends of Arctic terrestrial birds (88 species, 228 subspecies or distinct flyway populations) across guilds/regions, derived from published sources, raw data or, in rare cases, expert opinion. We report long-term trends in vital rates (survival, reproduction) for the handful of species and regions for which these are available. Over half of all circumpolar Arctic wader taxa are declining (51% of 91 taxa with known trends) and almost half of all waterfowl are increasing (49% of 61 taxa); these opposing trends have fostered a shift in community composition in some locations. Declines were least prevalent in the African-Eurasian Flyway (29%), but similarly prevalent in the remaining three global flyways (44–54%). Widespread, and in some cases accelerating, declines underscore the urgent conservation needs faced by many Arctic terrestrial bird species.",2348262588,,Scholarly Journals," National Wildlife Research Centre, Wildlife Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X); National Wildlife Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X) , York University, Department of Multidisciplinary Studies and Graduate Program in Biology, Toronto, Canada (GRID:grid.21100.32) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 9430) , Aarhus University, Department of Bioscience, Roskilde, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722) , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Migratory Bird Management, Anchorage, USA (GRID:grid.7048.b) , Aarhus University, Department of Bioscience, Rønde, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722) , National Wildlife Research Centre, Wildlife Research Division, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X); Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service, Winnipeg, Canada (GRID:grid.410334.1) (ISNI:0000 0001 2184 7612); National Wildlife Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X) , Lomonosov Moscow State University, Department of Vertebrate Zoology, Moscow, Russia (GRID:grid.14476.30) (ISNI:0000 0001 2342 9668) , University of Alberta, Department of Biological Sciences, Edmonton, Canada (GRID:grid.17089.37) , www.vandrefalk.dk, Stockholm, Sweden (GRID:grid.17089.37) , Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg, Russia (GRID:grid.4886.2) (ISNI:0000 0001 2192 9124) , Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg, Russia (GRID:grid.4886.2) (ISNI:0000 0001 2192 9124) , Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology, Arctic Research Station, Labytnangi, Russia (GRID:grid.482778.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 2197 0186) , Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.410334.1) (ISNI:0000 0001 2184 7612); Carleton University, Department of Biology, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X); National Wildlife Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada (GRID:grid.34428.39) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 893X)","Smith, Paul A;McKinnon, Laura;Meltofte Hans;Lanctot, Richard B;Fox, Anthony D;Leafloor, James O;Soloviev Mikhail;Franke, Alastair;Falk Knud;Golovatin Mikhail;Sokolov Vasiliy;Sokolov Aleksandr;Smith, Adam C"," Ambio is a copyright of Springer, (2020).

Status and trends in Arctic vegetation: Evidence from experimental warming and long-term monitoring,"Changes in Arctic vegetation can have important implications for trophic interactions and ecosystem functioning leading to climate feedbacks. Plot-based vegetation surveys provide detailed insight into vegetation changes at sites around the Arctic and improve our ability to predict the impacts of environmental change on tundra ecosystems. Here, we review studies of changes in plant community composition and phenology from both long-term monitoring and warming experiments in Arctic environments. We find that Arctic plant communities and species are generally sensitive to warming, but trends over a period of time are heterogeneous and complex and do not always mirror expectations based on responses to experimental manipulations. Our findings highlight the need for more geographically widespread, integrated, and comprehensive monitoring efforts that can better resolve the interacting effects of warming and other local and regional ecological factors.",2200090601,,Scholarly Journals," Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung, Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F), Frankfurt, Germany (GRID:grid.438154.f) (ISNI:0000 0001 0944 0975); Aarhus University, Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity, Department of Bioscience, Aarhus, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722) , University of Edinburgh, School of GeoSciences, Edinburgh, UK (GRID:grid.4305.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7988) , University of Edinburgh, School of GeoSciences, Edinburgh, UK (GRID:grid.4305.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7988) , Fram Centre, Norwegian Polar Institute, Tromsö, Norway (GRID:grid.417991.3) , University of Iceland, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Reykjavík, Iceland (GRID:grid.14013.37) (ISNI:0000 0004 0640 0021) , Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Trondheim, Norway (GRID:grid.420127.2) (ISNI:0000 0001 2107 519X) , U.S. National Park Service, Inventory and Monitoring Program, Anchorage, USA (GRID:grid.420127.2) , Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Swedish Species Information Centre, Uppsala, Sweden (GRID:grid.6341.0) (ISNI:0000 0000 8578 2742) , Yukon Conservation Data Centre, Whitehorse, Canada (GRID:grid.6341.0) , Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Forest Resource Management, Umeå, Sweden (GRID:grid.6341.0) (ISNI:0000 0000 8578 2742) , Icelandic Institute of Natural History, Akureyri Division, Akureyri, Iceland (GRID:grid.435368.f) (ISNI:0000 0001 0660 3759) , Aarhus University, Arctic Ecosystem Ecology, Department of Bioscience, Roskilde, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722) , Aarhus University, Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity, Department of Bioscience, Aarhus, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722); Aarhus University, Arctic Research Center, Department of Bioscience, Århus, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722); Aarhus University, Center for Biodiversity Dynamic in a Changing World (BIOCHANGE), Department of Bioscience, Århus, Denmark (GRID:grid.7048.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 1956 2722)","Bjorkman, Anne D;García Criado Mariana;Myers-Smith, Isla H;Ravolainen Virve;Jónsdóttir Ingibjörg Svala;Westergaard, Kristine Bakke;Lawler, James P;Aronsson Mora;Bennett, Bruce;Gardfjell Hans;Heiðmarsson Starri;Stewart Laerke;Normand Signe"," Ambio is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Global plant trait relationships extend to the climatic extremes of the tundra biome,"The majority of variation in six traits critical to the growth, survival and reproduction of plant species is thought to be organised along just two dimensions, corresponding to strategies of plant size and resource acquisition. However, it is unknown whether global plant trait relationships extend to climatic extremes, and if these interspecific relationships are confounded by trait variation within species. We test whether trait relationships extend to the cold extremes of life on Earth using the largest database of tundra plant traits yet compiled. We show that tundra plants demonstrate remarkably similar resource economic traits, but not size traits, compared to global distributions, and exhibit the same two dimensions of trait variation. Three quarters of trait variation occurs among species, mirroring global estimates of interspecific trait variation. Plant trait relationships are thus generalizable to the edge of global trait-space, informing prediction of plant community change in a warming world. It is unclear whether plant trait relationships found at the global scale extend to climatic extremes. Here the authors analyse six major aboveground traits to show that known plant trait relationships extend to the tundra biomes and exhibit the same two dimensions of variation detected at the global scale.",2376708631,,Scholarly Journals," University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences, Edinburgh, UK (GRID:grid.4305.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7988) , University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences, Edinburgh, UK (GRID:grid.4305.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7988);

"Soil Microbial Community and Enzyme Activity Responses to Herbaceous Plant Expansion in the Changbai Mountains Tundra, China","As one of the most sensitive regions to global climate change, alpine tundra in many places around the world has been undergoing dramatic changes in vegetation communities over the past few decades. Herbaceous plant species in the Changbai Mountains area have significantly expanded into tundra shrub communities over the past 30 yr. Soil microbial communities, enzyme activities, and soil nutrients are intertwined with this expansion process. In order to understand the responses of the soil microbial communities to such an expansion, we analyzed soil microbial community structures and enzyme activities in shrub tundra as well as areas with three different levels of herbaceous plant expansion. Our investigation was based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and 96-well microtiter plates. The results showed that herbs have expanded greatly in the tundra, and they have become the dominant species in herbaceous plant expansion areas. There were differences for community composition and appearance among the shrub tundra and the mild expansion, moderate expansion, and severe expansion areas. Except for soil organic matter, soil nutrients were increased in herbaceous plant expansion areas, and the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), and available phosphorus (AP) were greatest in moderate expansion areas (MOE), while soil organic matter levels were highest in the non-expanded areas (CK). The total soil PLFAs in the three levels of herbaceous plant expansion areas were significantly higher than those in the non-expanded areas, and total soil PLFAs were highest in the moderately expanded area and lowest in the severely expanded area (SEE). Bacteria increased significantly more than fungi and actinomycetes with herbaceous plant expansion. Soil hydrolase activities (β-1,4-glucosidase (βG) activity, β-1, 4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity, and acid phosphatase (aP) activity) were highest in MOE and lowest in the CK treatment. Soil oxidase activities (polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities and peroxidase (PER) activities) were also highest in MOE, but they were lowest in the SEE treatment. The variations in total soil PLFAs with herbaceous plant expansion were mostly correlated with soil organic matter and available phosphorus concentrations, while soil enzyme activities were mostly correlated with the total soil nitrogen concentration. Our results suggest that herbaceous plant expansion increase the total soil PLFAs and soil enzyme activities and improved soil nutrients. However, soil microorganisms, enzyme activity, and nutrients responded differently to levels of herbaceous plant expansion. The soil conditions in mild and moderate expansion areas are more favorable than those in severe expansion areas.",2250840406,,Scholarly Journals," Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; School of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China","Jin, Yinghua;Zhang, Yingjie;Xu, Zhiwei;Gu, Xiaonan;Xu, Jiawei;Yan, Tao;He, Hongshi;Wang, Ailin;Liu, Yuxia;Niu, Liping"," Chinese Geographical Science is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Functional diversity along elevational gradients in the high altitude vegetation of the western Himalaya,"The analysis of species distribution and functional diversity (FD) in natural gradients of aridity and temperature at high altitudes could provide indication of future changes in plant communities as both are responsive to environment and strongly influence ecosystem functioning and stability. We established eleven altitudinal transects in high altitude region of western Himalaya, six of which represented north aspect and the rest represented south aspect. In each transect, vegetation was sampled randomly at every 200&#xa0;m elevation to estimate species rarity, niche width and different FD indices [community-weighted mean traits (CWM), functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and functional specificity (FSpe)]. These indices indicate resource utilization, competition for resources, optimal plant strategies, and presence of functionally specialist species. We found a total of 418 plant species, most of which were having narrow niche and distribution. Proportion of species with narrow niche was high at higher elevations, 36.5% species were rare with 17% of them being endemic to Himalaya. At south aspect, lower values of CWM plant height along with lower FRic, FDiv, FDis, and FSpe were recorded. Further, CWM plant height, FRic, FDiv, FDis and FSpe significantly decreased with increasing elevation. Influence of gradients of aridity (aspect) and decreasing temperature (elevation) on species distribution and FD suggest that functioning of high altitude communities is very likely to be affected in future. Our findings therefore emphasize that the plant communities present at higher elevations are more vulnerable under climate change.",2188816435,,Scholarly Journals," CSIR - Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT), Palampur, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IHBT, Palampur, India , CSIR - Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT), Palampur, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IHBT, Palampur, India","Thakur, Dinesh;Chawla, Amit"," Biodiversity and Conservation is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Herbaceous Encroachment from Mountain Birch Forests to Alpine Tundra Plant Communities Through Above- and Belowground Competition,"Alpine plant communities are highly sensitive to global warming. One of the consequences of the warming is encroachment by herbaceous plants from forests at low elevations into alpine ecosystems. In the Changbai Mountains, narrowleaf small reed ( Deyeuxia angustifolia (Kom.) Y. L. Chang) from mountain birch forests encroached upward into alpine tundra, gradually replacing native tundra shrubs such as Rhododendron ( Rhododendron aureum Georgi). How encroaching plants affect native plant communities is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed above- and belowground biomass of alpine plant communities at five encroachment levels to investigate how biomass allocation changed at species and community scales. Our research showed that native plants are forced to change their morphology to cope with competition, at both above- and belowground levels, from encroaching plants. We found that (1) R. aureum increased the shoot height and leaf area in order to compete with D. angustifolia ; (2) above- and belowground biomass of D. angustifolia increased while above- and belowground biomass of R. aureum decreased with increasing levels of encroachment; and (3) D. angustifolia encroachment reduced the total biomass of alpine tundra. Encroachment by herbaceous plants has a long-term negative impact on the ability of tundra plants to sequester carbon in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains.",2548514811,,Scholarly Journals," Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China; School of Natural Resources, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China , Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security in Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education, School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China","Tan, Xinyuan;He, Hong S;Zong, Shengwei;Wu, Miaomiao;Liu, Kai;Zhao, Dandan"," © 2019 by the authors.

Warming shortens flowering seasons of tundra plant communities,"Advancing phenology is one of the most visible effects of climate change on plant communities, and has been especially pronounced in temperature-limited tundra ecosystems. However, phenological responses have been shown to differ greatly between species, with some species shifting phenology more than others. We analysed a database of 42,689 tundra plant phenological observations to show that warmer temperatures are leading to a contraction of community-level flowering seasons in tundra ecosystems due to a greater advancement in the flowering times of late-flowering species than early-flowering species. Shorter flowering seasons with a changing climate have the potential to alter trophic interactions in tundra ecosystems. Interestingly, these findings differ from those of warmer ecosystems, where early-flowering species have been found to be more sensitive to temperature change, suggesting that community-level phenological responses to warming can vary greatly between biomes. Analysing a global database of &gt;40,000 tundra plant phenological observations monitored for up to 20 years, the authors show that community-level flowering has been contracting in response to recent warming, in contrast to findings from lower latitudes.",2389687328,,Scholarly Journals," US Department of Agriculture, Pacific Northwest Research Station, US Forest Service, Olympia, USA;

Elevational variation of body size and reproductive traits in high-latitude wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae),"Environmental gradients can help us comprehend the range of adaptations or plasticity that a given species can exhibit in response to climatic change. In this study, we assessed the response in female body size, clutch size and egg volume to elevational gradients in closely related wolf spiders. We measured these traits in Pardosa glacialis , P. hyperborea , P. furcifera and P. palustris , collected along elevational gradients across six sites in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions (four sites in Greenland, one in Iceland and one in the Faroe Islands), although not all species were found at all sites. Body size and reproductive traits did not vary with elevation in a consistent manner among species although smaller species were more sensitive to the gradients. The positive relationship between body size and clutch size was most pronounced in the larger species, indicating that larger species are better able to translate favourable environmental conditions into a larger reproductive output. Our study illustrates that elevational gradients may not fully capture spatial variation in environmental conditions experienced by high-latitude wolf spider species.",2109030630,,Scholarly Journals," Université de Rennes 1, Rennes Cedex, France; Evolutionary Biology, Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland , Department of Bioscience and Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, Rønde, Denmark , Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark; Canadian Forest Service - Atlantic Forestry Centre, Corner Brook, NL, Canada , Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark , Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark; Natural History Museum Aarhus, Aarhus C, Denmark , Université de Rennes 1, Rennes Cedex, France , Université de Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553 ECOBIO, Paimpont, France , Université de Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553 ECOBIO, Rennes Cedex, France","Ameline, Camille;Høye, Toke Thomas;Bowden, Joseph James;Rikke Reisner Hansen;Oskar Liset Pryds Hansen;Puzin, Charlène;Vernon, Philippe;Pétillon, Julien"," Polar Biology is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

"Climate warming and the arrival of potentially invasive species into boreal forest and tundra in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada","As the extremity of Arctic climate lessens with global warming, the risk of invasion increases. We assess the presence of introduced plant species and their persistence (since the previous survey) in a Canadian subpolar site on the Hudson Bay with a history of human introductions from large-scale grain inputs. Widespread sampling was done to locate all introduced plant species in the Churchill, MB, Canada area. We quantified edaphic variations through soil sampling, and the effect of aspect on introduced species’ richness, cover, and height. At the regional scale, species life history traits and climate envelopes (average and variability of climate in a native range) were established to determine if persistent plant species had similar climate requirements. We found that despite statistically significant warming and increased precipitation, the number of introduced plant species in sub-Arctic Churchill declined from 80 to 36 between the 1989 and 2013 sampling periods. We found that introduced species favor locally warmer, human-disturbed sites with above average soil nutrients. The plant species that remained in Churchill since the 1989 survey compared to those that did not persist are better able to tolerate colder temperatures and have wider, more variable climate envelopes. The decline in introduced species is likely linked to changes in grain shipment inputs. Many of the introduced species recorded in 1989 may have only existed through constant seed subsidies from imports, suggesting that most species have not yet been successful in the absence of human modification. Although the number of introduced plants has decreased, we suggest that continuous disturbance is no longer required for some introduced species to persist suggesting that a climate threshold may have been crossed for some species. One introduced species ( Taraxacum officinale , common dandelion) has spread to areas that have not been modified by humans and is now growing in two undisturbed locations. Its current distribution outside disturbed areas does not yet warrant the distinction of invasive at this time. The findings of this study suggest that in the Canadian Arctic, if disturbance and nutrient enrichment are reduced, the potential for introduced plants to establish and possibly become invasive is still limited but will likely change as warming continues.",2047953312,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Geography, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada , Department of Geography, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada , Department of Geography, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada","Kent, Alex;Drezner, Taly Dawn;Bello, Richard"," Polar Biology is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Flower colour within communities shifts from overdispersed to clustered along an alpine altitudinal gradient,"Altitudinal gradients are interesting models to test the effect of biotic and abiotic drivers of floral colour diversity, since an increase in UV irradiance, decrease of pollinator availability and shifts from bee- to fly-pollination in high relative to low altitudes are expected. We tested the effect of altitude and phylogeny, using several chromatic and achromatic colour properties, UV reflectance and pollinators’ discrimination capacity ( Apis mellifera , Bombus terrestris , Musca domestica and Eristalis tenax ), to understand the floral colour diversity in an alpine altitudinal gradient. All colour properties were weakly related to phylogeny. We found a shift from overdispersed floral colours and high chromatic contrast with the background (for bees) in the low altitude, to clustered floral colours (UV and green range for bees and flies) and clustered chromatic and achromatic properties in the high altitude. Different from flies, bees could discriminate floral colours in all altitudinal ranges. Low altitudes are likely to exhibit suitable conditions for more plant species, increasing competition for pollinators and floral colour divergence. Conversely, the increase in UV irradiance in high altitudes may filter plants with specific floral UV-reflectance patterns. Overall, floral colour diversity suggests that both biotic (pollinator fauna) and abiotic (UV irradiance) drivers shape floral communities, but their importance changes with altitude.",2053771592,,Scholarly Journals," Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil , Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ecologia e Conservação de Recursos Naturais, Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, Uberlândia, MG, Brazil , Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, UK , Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, Uberlândia, MG, Brazil","Bergamo, Pedro Joaquim;Francismeire Jane Telles;Arnold, Sarah E J;Vinícius Lourenço Garcia de Brito"," Oecologia is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

"Egg size versus egg number trade-off in the alpine-tundra wolf spider, <i>Pardosa palustris</i> (Araneae: Lycosidae)","The effect of environmental conditions on reproductive traits in spiders is not completely understood. We studied the trade-off between the egg number and egg size of a common spider species along an elevational gradient in Norway. Life history theory predicts that egg size should decrease and clutch size increase as temperatures rise. In 2006, 2010, and 2014, female lycosid spiders ( Pardosa palustris ) carrying first egg sacs were hand sampled from 690 to 1460&#xa0;m above sea level (a.s.l.). The eggs were counted, and the body and egg sizes for each female were individually estimated using digital photography. An analysis of covariance was performed using linear mixed-effects models to test for trade-off differences between sampling years, and along the elevational gradient. Unexpectedly, the egg size versus number trade-off was consistent along the elevational gradient, and thus appeared to be independent of elevation-induced temperature changes. However, this trade-off varied considerably between years. Egg-size variations in relation to body size appeared to be independent of year and did not vary along the elevational gradient. Our results revealed that the trade-off between egg number and egg size does not always hold and might be more plastic than assumed. This suggests that P. palustris , which has a broad habitat niche and a wide geographic distribution, will easily cope with temperature-regime shifts in cold environments. Consequently, this might lead to advantages regarding the offspring survival rate relative to coexisting species, and thus to changes in the terrestrial arthropod community of alpine-tundra ecosystems.",2015634416,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Geography, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany , Institute of Landscape and Plant Ecology, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany , Institute of Geography, FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany , Rastede, Germany , Department of Geography, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany","Hein, Nils;Brendel, Marco R;Feilhauer, Hannes;Oliver-D Finch;Löffler, Jörg"," Polar Biology is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Clonal plasticity and diversity facilitates the adaptation of Rhododendron aureum Georgi to alpine environment,"Four small oval populations and five large intensive populations of Rhododendron aureum growing at the alpine in Changbai Mountain (China) were studied in two types of habitat (in the tundra and in Betula ermanii forest). Identification and delimitation of genets were inferred from excavation in small populations and from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers by the standardized sampling design in large populations. Clonal architecture and clonal diversity were then estimated. For the four small populations, they were monoclonal, the spacer length (18.6 ± 5.6 in tundra, 29.7 ± 9.7 in Betula ermanii forest, P &lt; 0.05) was shorter and branching intensity (136.7 ± 32.9 in tundra, 43.4 ± 12.3 in Betula ermanii forest, P &lt; 0.05) was higher in the tundra than that in Betula ermanii forest. For the five large populations, they were composed of multiple genets with high level of clonal diversity (Simpson’s index D = 0.84, clonal richness R = 0.25, Fager's evenness E = 0.85); the spatial distribution of genets showed that the clonal growth strategy of R . aureum exhibits both guerilla and phalanx. Our results indicate that the clonal plasticity of R . aureum could enhance exploitation of resource heterogeneity and in turn greatly contribute to maintenance or improvement of fitness and the high clonal diversity of R . aureum increase the evolutionary rates to adapt the harsh alpine environment in Changbai Mountain.",2037055507,,Scholarly Journals,,"Wang, Xiaolong;Zhao, Wei;Li, Lin;You, Jian;Ni, Biao;Chen, Xia"," © 2018 Wang et al.

"How shrub encroachment under climate change could threaten pollination services for alpine wildflowers: A case study using the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum","Under climate change, shrubs encroaching into high altitude plant communities disrupt ecosystem processes. Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum . Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium . To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing.",1936037144,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Applied Ecology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA , Biological Science Department, Webster University, Saint Louis, MO, USA , Department of Biology, Colorado College, Colorado Springs, CO, USA , Division of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA","Kettenbach, Jessica A;Nicole Miller‐Struttmann;Moffett, Zoë;Galen, Candace"," © 2017.

Herbivores rescue diversity in warming tundra by modulating trait-dependent species losses and gains,"Climate warming is altering the diversity of plant communities but it remains unknown which species will be lost or gained under warming, especially considering interactions with other factors such as herbivory and nutrient availability. Here, we experimentally test effects of warming, mammalian herbivory and fertilization on tundra species richness and investigate how plant functional traits affect losses and gains. We show that herbivory reverses the impact of warming on diversity: in the presence of herbivores warming increases species richness through higher species gains and lower losses, while in the absence of herbivores warming causes higher species losses and thus decreases species richness. Herbivores promote gains of short-statured species under warming, while herbivore removal and fertilization increase losses of short-statured and resource-conservative species through light limitation. Our results demonstrate that both rarity and traits forecast species losses and gains, and mammalian herbivores are essential for preventing trait-dependent extinctions and mitigate diversity loss under warming and eutrophication.",1935255389,,Scholarly Journals," Climate Impacts Research Centre (CIRC), Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Umeå University, Abisko, Sweden; Department of Biology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium , Department of Physiological Diversity, Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research—UFZ, Leipzig, Germany; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Department of Ecology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland , Climate Impacts Research Centre (CIRC), Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, Umeå University, Abisko, Sweden","Kaarlejärvi, Elina;Eskelinen, Anu;Olofsson, Johan"," © 2017.

Human disturbance and upward expansion of plants in a warming climate,"Climate change is expected to trigger an upward expansion of plants in mountain regions and, although there is strong evidence that many native species have already shifted their distributions to higher elevations, little is known regarding how fast non-native species might respond to climate change. By analysing 131,394 occurrence records of 1,334 plant species collected over 20 years in the European Alps, we found that non-natives are spreading upwards approximately twice as fast as natives. Whereas the spread of natives was enhanced by traits favouring longer dispersal distances, this was not the case for non-natives. This was due to the non-native species pool already being strongly biased towards species that had traits facilitating spread. A large proportion of native and non-native species seemed to be able to spread upwards faster than the current velocity of climate change. In particular, long-distance dispersal events and proximity to roads proved to be key drivers for the observed rapid spread. Our findings highlight that invasions by non-native species into native alpine communities are a potentially significant additional pressure on these vulnerable ecosystems that are already likely to suffer dramatic vegetation changes with ongoing warming and increasing human activity in mountain regions.",1925188313,,Scholarly Journals,,"Dainese, Matteo;Aikio, Sami;Hulme, Philip E;Bertolli, Alessio;Prosser, Filippo;Marini, Lorenzo", Copyright Nature Publishing Group Aug 2017,10.1038/nclimate3337, Journal Article,, Aug 2017,1758-678X,8, English, English, 577-580, London,Aug 2017,Nature Climate Change,2017,7,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/human-disturbance-upward-expansion-plants-warming/docview/1925188313/se-2?accountid=12870,,,, 577,," Climate , Vegetation changes , Ecosystems , Climate change , Proximity , Climate change , Plants , Climate change , Climate change , Mountain regions , Alpine environments , Dispersion , Dispersal , Velocity , Vegetation changes , Ecosystems , Native species , Dispersal , Dispersal , Velocity , Nonnative species , Invasive species , Climate change , Ecosystem disturbance , Vulnerability , Introduced species , Invasive species , Ecosystems , Current velocity , Global warming , Plant species , Introduced species , Climate change",,,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asciencejournals&amp;atitle=Human+disturbance+and+upward+expansion+of+plants+in+a+warming+climate&amp;title=Nature+Climate+Change&amp;issn=1758678X&amp;date=2017-08-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=577&amp;au=Dainese%2C+Matteo%3BAikio%2C+Sami%3BHulme%2C+Philip+E%3BBertolli%2C+Alessio%3BProsser%2C+Filippo%3BMarini%2C+Lorenzo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Nature+Climate+Change&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1038%2Fnclimate3337,SciTech Premium Collection
"Effects of Cushion Plants on High-Altitude Soil Microarthropod Communities: Cushions Increase Abundance and Diversity of Mites (Acari), but not Springtails (Collembola)","  Cushion plants in alpine ecosystems act as nurse species, which modify and alleviate environmental conditions and positively influence the diversity and abundance of other organisms. Soil fauna in alpine environments should benefit from nurse plant facilitation, but this has not been investigated. We compared diversity, abundance, and community structure of soil microarthropods (Collembola, Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata, Endeostigmata, and Astigmata) under cushion plants and in adjacent open microsites in high altitude patterned ground landscapes in New Zealand. We investigated how cushion plants influence environmental factors, and how environmental factors and species traits contribute to microarthropod community structure. The results show that cushion plants are a key in maintaining the biodiversity of soil microarthropods in the high alpine. Cushion plants maintain higher moisture and organic matter content in the soil, provide productive and structurally complex habitat, and mitigate disturbance. Abundance and species richness of Oribatida, Mesostigmata, and Prostigmata were higher under cushion plants. In contrast, abundance of Collembola was higher in open microsites, while their species richness similar in and out of cushions. Oribatida assemblages were dominated by small asexual species, indicating a disturbed environment. Oribatida community structure was significantly related to the microhabitat in two out of three mountain ranges. Collembola assemblages were similar in and out of cushions. Higher soil moisture and organic matter content under cushion plants were significant in explaining patterns in microarthropod assemblages, although high percentage of variability was not explained by environmental variables. There was no effect of cushions on soil temperatures. Species identity of the cushion plant did not influence abundance, species richness, or community assemblages of mites and springtails; however, some species were associated with either Dracophyllum or Raoulia cushions.",1814746233,,Scholarly Journals,,"Minor, M A;Babenko, A B;Ermilov, S G;Khaustov, A A;Makarova, O L", Copyright Allen Press Publishing Services Aug 2016,10.1657/AAAR0015-064, Journal Article,, Aug 2016,1523-0430,3, English, English, 485-500, Boulder,Aug 2016,"Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research",2016,48,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effects-cushion-plants-on-high-altitude-soil/docview/1814746233/se-2,,,, 485,,,,,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amgamodule&amp;atitle=Effects+of+Cushion+Plants+on+High-Altitude+Soil+Microarthropod+Communities%3A+Cushions+Increase+Abundance+and+Diversity+of+Mites+%28Acari%29%2C+but+not+Springtails+%28Collembola%29&amp;title=Arctic%2C+Antarctic%2C+and+Alpine+Research&amp;issn=15230430&amp;date=2016-08-01&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=485&amp;au=Minor%2C+M+A%3BBabenko%2C+A+B%3BErmilov%2C+S+G%3BKhaustov%2C+A+A%3BMakarova%2C+O+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Arctic%2C+Antarctic%2C+and+Alpine+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1657%2FAAAR0015-064,SciTech Premium Collection
Dwarf pine invasion in an alpine tundra of discontinuous permafrost area: effects on fine root and soil carbon dynamics,"  Issue Title: Special Issue on Dynamics and Physiological Processes of Tree Roots Key message Recent invasion of Pinus pumila , a highly productive shrub-like tree species, into alpine tundra does not significantly modify the dynamics of fine root and soil carbon in the tundra. Abstract Climate warming may directly and indirectly affect the large carbon stock in discontinuous permafrost soil at high latitudes. In recent decades, Siberian dwarf pine [Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel] has been invading dry heath alpine tundra in the northern Amur region of Far East Russia. Siberian dwarf pine is known to have high aboveground productivity, comparable to that of tall coniferous trees. We hypothesised that the invasion of Siberian dwarf pine into alpine tundra could increase soil carbon stocks via an increase in fine roots. Contrary to our expectations, the invasion of dwarf pine did not significantly increase the fine root biomass and productivity of the tundra, probably due to the belowground competitive exclusion between the dwarf pine and alpine tundra plants. Furthermore, the invasion of the dwarf pine did not affect soil carbon in the alpine tundra ecosystem. These results show that the recent invasion of Siberian dwarf pine into tundra did not influence the fine root dynamics or the soil carbon stock in the study site. Together, these results implied that (1) it takes a long time for pine invasion to change the belowground ecosystem properties of tundra vegetation to that of pine thickets and therefore (2) the lack of an increase in soil carbon from recent tree invasion should be taken into account when modelling future carbon dynamics in alpine tundra.

Non-native and native organisms moving into high elevation and high latitude ecosystems in an era of climate change: new challenges for ecology and conservation,"  Cold environments at high elevation and high latitude are often viewed as resistant to biological invasions. However, climate warming, land use change and associated increased connectivity all increase the risk of biological invasions in these environments. Here we present a summary of the key discussions of the workshop 'Biosecurity in Mountains and Northern Ecosystems: Current Status and Future Challenges' (Flen, Sweden, 1-3 June 2015). The aims of the workshop were to (1) increase awareness about the growing importance of species expansion--both non-native and native--at high elevation and high latitude with climate change, (2) review existing knowledge about invasion risks in these areas, and (3) encourage more research on how species will move and interact in cold environments, the consequences for biodiversity, and animal and human health and wellbeing. The diversity of potential and actual invaders reported at the workshop and the likely interactions between them create major challenges for managers of cold environments. However, since these cold environments have experienced fewer invasions when compared with many warmer, more populated environments, prevention has a real chance of success, especially if it is coupled with prioritisation schemes for targeting invaders likely to have greatest impact. Communication and co-operation between cold environment regions will facilitate rapid response, and maximise the use of limited research and management resources.",1761615855,,Scholarly Journals,,"Pauchard, Aníbal;Milbau, Ann;Albihn, Ann;Alexander, Jake;Burgess, Treena;Daehler, Curtis;Englund, Göran;Essl, Franz;Evengård, Birgitta;Greenwood, Gregory B;Haider, Sylvia;Lenoir, Jonathan;Mcdougall, Keith;Muths, Erin;Nuñez, Martin A;Olofsson, Johan;Pellissier, Loic;Rabitsch, Wolfgang;Rew, Lisa J;Robertson, Mark;Sanders, Nathan;Kueffer, Christoph", Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016,10.1007/s10530-015-1025-x, Feature,, Feb 2016,1387-3547,2, English, English, 345-353, Dordrecht,Feb 2016,Biological Invasions,2016,18,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/non-native-organisms-moving-into-high-elevation/docview/1761615855/se-2, References," Alien species , Arctic , Exotic species , Biosecurity , Migration , Range expansion , Risk , Sub-polar",, 345,," Land use , Climate change , Global warming , Ecosystems , Nonnative species"," Alien species , Arctic , Exotic species , Biosecurity , Migration , Range expansion , Risk , Sub-polar",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Abiologicalscijournals&amp;atitle=Non-native+and+native+organisms+moving+into+high+elevation+and+high+latitude+ecosystems+in+an+era+of+climate+change%3A+new+challenges+for+ecology+and+conservation&amp;title=Biological+Invasions&amp;issn=13873547&amp;date=2016-02-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=345&amp;au=Pauchard%2C+An%C3%ADbal%3BMilbau%2C+Ann%3BAlbihn%2C+Ann%3BAlexander%2C+Jake%3BBurgess%2C+Treena%3BDaehler%2C+Curtis%3BEnglund%2C+G%C3%B6ran%3BEssl%2C+Franz%3BEveng%C3%A5rd%2C+Birgitta%3BGreenwood%2C+Gregory+B%3BHaider%2C+Sylvia%3BLenoir%2C+Jonathan%3BMcdougall%2C+Keith%3BMuths%2C+Erin%3BNu%C3%B1ez%2C+Martin+A%3BOlofsson%2C+Johan%3BPellissier%2C+Loic%3BRabitsch%2C+Wolfgang%3BRew%2C+Lisa+J%3BRobertson%2C+Mark%3BSanders%2C+Nathan%3BKueffer%2C+Christoph&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Biological+Invasions&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10530-015-1025-x,SciTech Premium Collection
Fire-severity effects on plant–fungal interactions after a novel tundra wildfire disturbance: implications for arctic shrub and tree migration,"Background Vegetation change in high latitude tundra ecosystems is expected to accelerate due to increased wildfire activity. High-severity fires increase the availability of mineral soil seedbeds, which facilitates recruitment, yet fire also alters soil microbial composition, which could significantly impact seedling establishment. Results We investigated the effects of fire severity on soil biota and associated effects on plant performance for two plant species predicted to expand into Arctic tundra. We inoculated seedlings in a growth chamber experiment with soils collected from the largest tundra fire recorded in the Arctic and used molecular tools to characterize root-associated fungal communities. Seedling biomass was significantly related to the composition of fungal inoculum. Biomass decreased as fire severity increased and the proportion of pathogenic fungi increased. Conclusions Our results suggest that effects of fire severity on soil biota reduces seedling performance and thus we hypothesize that in certain ecological contexts fire-severity effects on plant–fungal interactions may dampen the expected increases in tree and shrub establishment after tundra fire.",2424875679,,Scholarly Journals,,"Hewitt, Rebecca E;Hollingsworth, Teresa N;Chapin, F Stuart, III;D.

Inconclusive Predictions and Contradictions: A Lack of Consensus on Seed Germination Response to Climate Change at High Altitude and High Latitude,"  Climate change directly affects arctic-alpine plants and acute responses to increased temperatures may be seen in their reproductive fitness and germination ability. However, uncertainties prevail in predicting whether a future warmer climate favors or hampers seed germination in high latitude and high altitude soils and seed germination research in such systems has not been able to provide generalizable patterns of response. The available literature on this subject has been conducted at various locations contributing to difficulties in predicting the response of arctic-alpine seeds to climate change. Here, we show that discrepancies in seed collection, dormancy breaking treatments, and germination conditions found in the published literature are possible reasons for our inability to draw large scale conclusions. We explore how these factors influence the results and highlight the fact that many of the previous investigations have reported the effects of warmer temperature, rather than a warmer climate and all the associated complex environmental interactions, on seed germination. We recommend that long-term monitoring of seed response to treatments that mimic the present and future alpine climate is likely to produce more ecologically meaningful insights and suggest several practical steps that researchers can take that would facilitate greater coherence between studies.",1779835574,,Scholarly Journals,,"Jaganathan, Ganesh K;Dalrymple, Sarah E"," Copyright © 2016 Ganesh K.

Community and species‐specific responses to simulated global change in two subarctic‐alpine plant communities,"Long‐term observational studies have detected greening and shrub encroachment in the subarctic attributed to current climate change, while global change simulations have showed that community composition and productivity may shift drastically in arctic, subarctic, and alpine tundra plant communities in the future. However, responses to global change can be highly species‐ and context‐dependent. We examined community‐level and species‐specific responses to a six‐year factorial temperature and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) amendment experiment in two alpine plant communities in northern Sweden: a species‐poor dwarf shrub heath, and a more species‐rich meadow. We hypothesized that abundance responses to global change would be variable within commonly defined vascular plant functional groups (e.g., forbs, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs) and that new species would appear in experimental plots over time due to the ameliorated growing conditions. We found that within most functional groups, species were highly individualistic with respect to the global change simulation, particularly within the forbs, whereas within the shrubs, responses were neutral to negative and widely variable in magnitude. In the heath community the response of the graminoid functional group was driven almost entirely by the grass Calamagrostis lapponica, which increased in abundance by an order of magnitude in the combined temperature and nutrient treatment. Furthermore, community context was important for species' responses to the simulations. Abundance of the pan‐arctic species Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis‐idaea responded primarily to the temperature treatment in the meadow community whereas the nutrient treatment had stronger effects in the heath community. Over six growing seasons, more new species appeared in the experimental plots than in control plots in the meadow community, whereas in the heath community only one new species appeared. Our results from two closely situated but different plant communities show that functional groups do not predict individual species responses to simulated global change, and that these responses depend to a large extent on pre‐existing physical conditions as well as biotic interactions such as competition and facilitation. It may be difficult to apply general trends of global change responses to specific local communities.",2299129188,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Ecology and Genetics, Uppsala University, Campus Gotland, 621 67 Visby, Sweden; Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Department of Aquatic Ecology, 8600 Dübendorf, Switzerland , VTI, Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, 102 15 Stockholm, Sweden , Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, 405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden , Department of Ecology and Genetics, Uppsala University, Campus Gotland, 621 67 Visby, Sweden","Little, Chelsea J;Jägerbrand, Annika K;Molau, Ulf;Alatalo, Juha M"," © 2015.

Susceptibility of burned black spruce (Picea mariana) forests to non-native plant invasions in interior Alaska,"  As climate rapidly warms at high-latitudes, the boreal forest faces the simultaneous threats of increasing invasive plant abundances and increasing area burned by wildfire. Highly flammable and widespread black spruce (Picea mariana) forest represents a boreal habitat that may be increasingly susceptible to non-native plant invasion. This study assess the role of burn severity, site moisture and time elapsed since burning in determining the invisibility of black spruce forests. We conducted field surveys for presence of non-native plants at 99 burned black spruce forest sites burned in 2004 in three regions of interior Alaska that spanned a gradient of burn severities and site moisture levels, and a chronosequence of sites in a single region that had burned in 1987, 1994, and 1999. We also conducted a greenhouse experiment where we grew invasive plants in vegetation and soil cores taken from a subset of these sites. In both our field survey and the greenhouse experiment, regional differences in soils and vegetation between burn complexes outweighed local burn severity or site moisture in determining the invasibility of burned black spruce sites. In the greenhouse experiments using cores from the 2004 burns, we found that the invasive focal species grew better in cores with soil and vegetation properties characteristic of low severity burns. Invasive plant growth in the greenhouse was greater in cores from the chronosequence burns with higher soil water holding capacity or lower native vascular biomass. We concluded that there are differences in susceptibility to non-native plant invasions between different regions of boreal Alaska based on native species regeneration. Re-establishment of native ground cover vegetation, including rapidly colonizing bryophytes, appear to offer burned areas a level of resistance to invasive plant establishment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",1550060238,,Scholarly Journals,,"Spellman, Katie V;Mulder, Christa P; H;Hollingsworth, Teresa N", Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014,10.1007/s10530-013-0633-6, Feature,, Sep 2014,1387-3547,9, English, English, 1879-1895, Dordrecht,Sep 2014,Biological Invasions,2014,16,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/susceptibility-burned-black-spruce-picea-mariana/docview/1550060238/se-2?accountid=12870,,,, 1879,," Global warming , Flowers & plants , Forests , Habitats , Alaska",,,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Abiologicalscijournals&amp;atitle=Susceptibility+of+burned+black+spruce+%28Picea+mariana%29+forests+to+non-native+plant+invasions+in+interior+Alaska&amp;title=Biological+Invasions&amp;issn=13873547&amp;date=2014-09-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=1879&amp;au=Spellman%2C+Katie+V%3BMulder%2C+Christa+P%3B+H%3BHollingsworth%2C+Teresa+N&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Biological+Invasions&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10530-013-0633-6,SciTech Premium Collection
Alpine climate alters the relationships between leaf and root morphological traits but not chemical traits,"  Leaves and fine roots are among the most important and dynamic components of terrestrial ecosystems. To what extent plants synchronize their resource capture strategies above- and belowground remains uncertain. Existing results of trait relationships between leaf and root showed great inconsistency, which may be partly due to the differences in abiotic environmental conditions such as climate and soil. Moreover, there is currently little evidence on whether and how the stringent environments of high-altitude alpine ecosystems alter the coordination between above- and belowground. Here we measured six sets of analogous traits for both leaves and fine roots of 139 species collected from Tibetan alpine grassland and Mongolian temperate grassland. N, P and N:P ratio of leaves and fine roots were positively correlated, independent of biogeographic regions, phylogenetic affiliation or climate. In contrast, leaves and fine roots seem to regulate morphological traits more independently. The specific leaf area (SLA)-specific root length (SRL) correlation shifted from negative at sites under low temperature to positive at warmer sites. The cold climate of alpine regions may impose different constraints on shoots and roots, selecting simultaneously for high SLA leaves for rapid C assimilation during the short growing season, but low SRL roots with high physical robustness to withstand soil freezing. In addition, there might be more community heterogeneity in cold soils, resulting in multidirectional strategies of root in resource acquisition. Thus our results demonstrated that alpine climate alters the relationships between leaf and root morphological but not chemical traits.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",1525779247, 24633995,Scholarly Journals,,"Geng, Yan;Wang, Liang;Jin, Dongmei;Liu, Huiying;He, Jin-sheng", Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014,10.1007/s00442-014-2919-5," Feature , Journal Article",, Jun 2014,0029-8549,2, English, English, 445-55, Heidelberg,Jun 2014,Oecologia,2014,175,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/alpine-climate-alters-relationships-between-leaf/docview/1525779247/se-2?accountid=12870,,,, 445," Altitude , Cold Temperature , Ecosystem , Plant Leaves -- anatomy & histology , Plant Roots -- anatomy & histology , Seasons , Soil",,, Soil,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Abiologicalscijournals&amp;atitle=Alpine+climate+alters+the+relationships+between+leaf+and+root+morphological+traits+but+not+chemical+traits&amp;title=Oecologia&amp;issn=00298549&amp;date=2014-06-01&amp;volume=175&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=445&amp;au=Geng%2C+Yan%3BWang%2C+Liang%3BJin%2C+Dongmei%3BLiu%2C+Huiying%3BHe%2C+Jin-sheng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Oecologia&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/24633995&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00442-014-2919-5,SciTech Premium Collection
"Reproductive Ecology and Severe Pollen Limitation in the Polychromic Tundra Plant, Parrya nudicaulis (Brassicaceae)","Pollen limitation is predicted to be particularly severe in tundra habitats. Numerous reproductive patterns associated with alpine and arctic species, particularly mechanisms associated with reproductive assurance, are suggested to be driven by high levels of pollen limitation. We studied the reproductive ecology of Parrya nudicaulis, a species with relatively large sexual reproductive investment and a wide range of floral pigmentation, in tundra habitats in interior montane Alaska to estimate the degree of pollen limitation. The plants are self-compatible and strongly protandrous, setting almost no seed in the absence of pollinators. Supplemental hand pollinations within pollinator exclusion cages indicated no cage effect on seed production. Floral visitation rates were low in both years of study and particularly infrequent in 2010. A diversity of insects visited P. nudicaulis, though syrphid and muscid flies composed the majority of all visits. Pollen-ovule ratios and levels of heterozygosity are consistent with a mixed mating system. Pollen limitation was severe; hand pollinations increased seed production per plant five-fold. Seed-to-ovule ratios remained low following hand pollinations, indicating resource limitation is likely to also be responsible for curtailing seed set. We suggest that pollen limitation in P. nudicaulis may be the result of selection favoring an overproduction of ovules as a bet-hedging strategy in this environmental context of highly variable pollen receipt.",1323992926,,Scholarly Journals,,"Fulkerson, Justin R;Whittall, Justen B;Carlson, Matthew L"," © 2012 Fulkerson et al.

"Shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems: dynamics, impacts and research priorities","Recent research using repeat photography, long-term ecological monitoring and dendrochronology has documented shrub expansion in arctic, high-latitude and alpine tundra ecosystems. Here, we (1)synthesize these findings, (2)present a conceptual framework that identifies mechanisms and constraints on shrub increase, (3)explore causes, feedbacks and implications of the increased shrub cover in tundra ecosystems, and (4)address potential lines of investigation for future research. Satellite observations from around the circumpolar Arctic, showing increased productivity, measured as changes in ‘greenness’, have coincided with a general rise in high-latitude air temperatures and have been partly attributed to increases in shrub cover. Studies indicate that warming temperatures, changes in snow cover, altered disturbance regimes as a result of permafrost thaw, tundra fires, and anthropogenic activities or changes in herbivory intensity are all contributing to observed changes in shrub abundance. Alarge-scale increase in shrub cover will change the structure of tundra ecosystems and alter energy fluxes, regional climate, soil–atmosphere exchange of water, carbon and nutrients, and ecological interactions between species. In order to project future rates of shrub expansion and understand the feedbacks to ecosystem and climate processes, future research should investigate the species or trait-specific responses of shrubs to climate change including: (1)the temperature sensitivity of shrub growth, (2)factors controlling the recruitment of new individuals, and (3)the relative influence of the positive and negative feedbacks involved in shrub expansion.",2551247327,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2E9, Canada;

Species effects on resource supply rates: do they influence competitive interactions?,"We examined two ways in which species effects on nitrogen supply rates could influence species competitive interactions and lead to coexistence between species with very different patterns of resource use. First, through differential effects on the rates of resource cycling, species may modify resources in divergent directions to better tolerate neighbors under self-modified conditions (tolerance modification). Second, plant-induced shifts in resource supply could enhance the degree to which species can suppress individuals (suppression modification). We addressed these hypothesized mechanisms in the non-successional moist meadow alpine tundra, which is codominated by Acomastylis rossii , a slow-growing roseaceous forb with high nutrient retention that is associated with slow rates of nitrogen supply, and Deschampsia caespitosa , a graminoid with rapid growth potential that is associated with fast rates of nitrogen (N) supply. Neighbors inhibited Acomastylis transplants (the species with high N retention) less than Deschampsia transplants (the species with rapid potential growth) in both neighborhood types, and hence neighborhood type did not influence species tolerance to neighbors. Likewise, Acomastylis neighborhoods inhibited transplant growth more than Deschampsia neighborhoods regardless of transplant species identity. When N supply rates were enhanced through repeated N additions in the two neighborhood types or in the presence of each species’ litter, the inhibitory effects associated with Acomastylis were offset to a greater degree than those associated with Deschampsia , as predicted by the suppression modification. These effects appeared to be density or size-dependent, with few effects observed at low density. Our results suggest that species effects on supply rates may influence competitive interactions, particularly if these effects are complemented by other sources of temporal or spatial variation such as pulses in resource availability.",2066487549,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA; Mountain Research Station, Nederland, CO, USA; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA; Mountain Research Station, Nederland, CO, USA , Mountain Research Station, Nederland, CO, USA; Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, USA , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA; Mountain Research Station, Nederland, CO, USA; Natural Resources Ecology Lab, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA , Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA; Mountain Research Station, Nederland, CO, USA","Katharine Nash Suding;Larson, Julia R;Thorsos, Eileen;Steltzer, Heidemarie;Bowman, William D"," Plant Ecology is a copyright of Springer, (2004).

Covariation in leaf and root traits for native and non-native grasses along an altitudinal gradient in New Zealand,"  Across 30 grassland sites in New Zealand that ranged from native alpine grasslands to low elevation improved pastures, there were consistent patterns of leaf and root traits and significant differences between native and non-native grasses. Plants of high altitude sites have low N concentrations in both their leaves and roots, have thick leaves and roots, yet no differences in tissue density or photosynthetic water use efficiency when compared to plants of low altitude sites. Both the leaves and roots of the low altitude plants were enriched in ^sup 15^N relative to the plants of higher altitude, indicating that the low-N set of traits is associated with a more closed N cycle at high altitude. A second independent set of correlations shows that plants of wetter habitats have lower photosynthetic water use efficiency (more negative [partial differential]^sup 13^C) and lower leaf and root tissue density than the plants of drier sites. For both leaves and roots, plants of native species consistently had traits associated with lower resource availability: lower N concentrations, denser tissues, more negative [partial differential]^sup 15^N, and more positive [partial differential]^sup 13^C than non-native species. If root %N is correlated with root longevity as has been shown in other systems, root longevity may be able to be predicted from simple measurements of leaf %N, though a hysteresis in the relationship between leaf and root N concentrations may make prediction of high longevity roots difficult.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",734479647, 12647118,Scholarly Journals,,"Craine, J M;Lee, W G", Springer-Verlag 2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1155-6, Journal Article,, Mar 2003,0029-8549,4, English, English, 471-8, Heidelberg,Mar 2003,Oecologia,2003,134,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/covariation-leaf-root-traits-native-non-grasses/docview/734479647/se-2?accountid=12870,,,, 471," New Zealand , Nitrogen -- metabolism , Plant Leaves -- chemistry , Plant Roots -- chemistry , Water -- metabolism",,," Nitrogen , Water",https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Abiologicalscijournals&amp;atitle=Covariation+in+leaf+and+root+traits+for+native+and+non-native+grasses+along+an+altitudinal+gradient+in+New+Zealand&amp;title=Oecologia&amp;issn=00298549&amp;date=2003-03-01&amp;volume=134&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=471&amp;au=Craine%2C+J+M%3BLee%2C+W+G&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Oecologia&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/12647118&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00442-002-1155-6,SciTech Premium Collection
